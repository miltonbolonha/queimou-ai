      "content": "\r\nFinding the right healthcare staffing solutions ensures your organization remains efficient and patient-centered. Whether you’re facing staff shortages or seeking specialized professionals, tailored staffing solutions can help you meet evolving healthcare demands with confidence and ease. Continue searching for the best solutions by exploring the options below.\r\n\r\n## Understanding Why Effective Healthcare Staffing is the Key to Success\r\n\r\nEffective healthcare staffing goes beyond merely filling positions; it requires a strategic approach that aligns workforce capabilities with the unique requirements of each healthcare organization. By adopting such an approach, healthcare providers can optimize patient outcomes, enhance operational efficiency, and foster a positive work environment for their healthcare personnel.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of effective healthcare staffing are multifaceted. Firstly, it directly impacts patient care. When healthcare facilities are adequately staffed with competent professionals, patients receive timely and appropriate medical attention, leading to improved health outcomes. Secondly, efficient staffing contributes to increased operational efficiency. Well-staffed healthcare organizations can streamline their processes, reduce patient wait times, and allocate resources more effectively, resulting in enhanced overall performance. Lastly, a well-structured staffing plan promotes job satisfaction among healthcare professionals. When staff members are appropriately matched to their roles and provided with the necessary support, they experience increased motivation, reduced burnout, and a greater sense of fulfillment in their work.\r\n\r\n## How Healthcare Staffing Agencies Improve Efficiency and Care\r\n\r\nTo ensure the highest standards of patient care, healthcare staffing agencies maintain a vast network of skilled healthcare professionals. These professionals encompass a diverse range of specialties, including physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and administrative personnel. Rigorous screening processes are employed to evaluate the qualifications, experience, and competencies of each candidate, guaranteeing that only the most qualified individuals are placed in healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\nSeveral popular healthcare staffing solutions include per diem staffing, travel nurses, and locum tenens. Per diem staffing offers flexible, short-term coverage for hospitals needing temporary assistance. Travel nurses fill gaps across different regions, bringing expertise to understaffed areas. Locum tenens provide temporary doctors and specialists, ensuring continuity of care during physician absences. These solutions help healthcare facilities maintain quality care while addressing workforce shortages.\r\n\r\nBy meticulously matching healthcare professionals with the appropriate roles, healthcare staffing agencies play a pivotal role in enhancing patient care and organizational efficiency. Their expertise in talent acquisition and management ensures that healthcare facilities have access to the skilled workforce they need to deliver exceptional healthcare services.\r\n\r\n## Exploring Some of the Best Healthcare Software Solutions\r\n\r\n### ShiftWise\r\n\r\nShiftWise is a powerful healthcare staffing solution that automates shift management and workforce allocation. It allows healthcare administrators to fill open shifts quickly by connecting them with a pool of qualified professionals. ShiftWise’s cloud-based platform integrates scheduling, compliance tracking, and vendor management, making it easy to maintain staffing efficiency. Its real-time data and reporting features provide insights into workforce performance, helping facilities make informed staffing decisions.\r\n\r\n### AMN Healthcare\r\n\r\nAMN Healthcare offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to streamline staffing, recruitment, and workforce planning. The platform is ideal for managing both permanent and temporary staff, with features like vendor management and predictive analytics. AMN Healthcare helps organizations optimize their staffing levels, improve patient care, and reduce costs.

Using data-driven algorithms, the platform connects healthcare facilities with nurses who are a perfect fit for their staffing needs. Trusted Health also simplifies the hiring process by offering transparency in pay and benefits. It empowers nurses with tools to track licenses, certifications, and career growth, while helping healthcare organizations efficiently manage nursing shortages.\r\n\r\n## Discover More About Effective Healthcare Staffing\r\n\r\nHealthcare staffing emerges as a critical factor in the success of healthcare organizations. By prioritizing effective staffing strategies, healthcare providers can elevate the quality of patient care, optimize operational efficiency, and cultivate a thriving work environment for their healthcare workforce.\r\n\r\nStay balanced, Emily.\r\n"

Discover your path to a free high school diploma online and explore your options below to start learning today!\r\n\r\n## Steps to Earning Your Free High School Diploma Online\r\n\r\n1. **Research Free Online Programs:**\r\n   Start by searching for online high schools that offer free diploma programs. Many public online schools funded by state education budgets provide free education to residents of the state. Look for programs accredited by well-established agencies to ensure you receive a quality education that’s recognized by colleges and employers.\r\n2. **Check Eligibility Requirements:**\r\n   Free online high school programs often have specific eligibility criteria based on residency, age, and previous schooling. Some might be aimed at adults who haven’t completed high school, while others are geared towards current high school students looking for an alternative. Make sure you meet the eligibility requirements before applying.\r\n3. **Apply to Multiple Programs:**\r\n   Since some free programs may have limited slots, consider applying to several schools to increase your chances of acceptance. Fill out applications thoroughly and submit any required documentation such as proof of residency and prior academic records.\r\n4. **Utilize State-Sponsored Resources:**\r\n   In many states, there are resources specifically designed to help residents obtain their high school diplomas online for free. These programs are often part of public or charter school initiatives. Check with your state’s department of education website for details on available programs.\r\n5. **Take Advantage of Library and Community Resources:**\r\n   Many community libraries and education centers offer support for students enrolled in online schooling. These might include free use of computers, internet access, and even tutoring services. Utilize these resources to supplement your online education.\r\n6. **Explore Scholarship Opportunities:**\r\n   Even if the tuition is free, other costs like books or technology might not be covered. Look for scholarships or grants specifically designed for online learners or adult students returning to school. These can help cover any additional costs associated with your education.\r\n7. **Stay Organized and Committed:**\r\n   Earning your diploma online requires discipline and commitment. Set up a consistent schedule to work on your courses. Use tools and apps to track your assignments and deadlines. Staying organized can help ensure you complete your program successfully.\r\n8. **Engage with Online School Communities:**\r\n   Being part of an online school doesn’t mean you have to miss out on the social aspects of school. Many online programs offer forums, virtual clubs, and online events where you can interact with teachers and fellow students. Engaging with your school community can enhance your learning experience and provide motivational support.\r\n\r\nEarning your high school diploma online for free is a fantastic way to enhance your education without financial strain. By choosing the right program and using available resources effectively, you can pave the way for future educational and career opportunities. With determination and focus, you can achieve your educational goals and open up new pathways for success.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nDental implants have the potential to completely transform your health and give you a beautiful smile. Thankfully it has now become more affordable than ever due to advances in technology that have driven down the manufacturing costs. Begin your search today for the lowest price dental implants near you.\r\n\r\nWhen any new technology is introduced, it will invariably come with a high price tag. This is understandable, as the tech will usually only be available from a limited number of suppliers. Moreover, the novel and new nature of the tech makes it inherently more desirable and interesting.\r\n\r\nThen there is the matter of maturity. A new technology is less refined than an established one, and will therefore be a more expensive and involved process. As technologies develop, we begin to see them refined as newer methods, tools, and systems are introduced. This helps to lower the price and improve the efficiency of the technology.\r\n\r\nThen there is the matter of competition. New technologies will usually only be offered by one or a few providers. This of course keeps the supply low, while driving up demand. Those few companies that offer the service can now choose how much they want to charge for the process.\r\n\r\nWith time though, competitors learn to offer products and services that are the same or at least comparable, and thus the prices are driven down.\r\n\r\n## Dental Implant Surgery: The Basics\r\n\r\nDental implant surgery involves the implantation of permanent tooth prosthetics. These artificial teeth are actually screwed into the gum and the jaw, which allows them to sit permanently in place and to behave just like any real tooth would.\r\n\r\nDental implants are ideal for those that wish to regain their old smile, and who don’t want to be forced to remove dentures at the end of every night. By combining implants with other techniques such as crowns, bridges, and more, a dentist can often reconstruct the smile in its entirety – even improving the whiteness and straightness of the original teeth!\r\n\r\nThe process of a dental implant is involved and invasive and requires multiple visits to the dentist. In some cases, you may require bone grafting. This is necessary if the jaw bone is too soft or thin, due to the huge amount of pressure placed on the tooth and jaw during chewing. Natural bone grafts from other parts of the body are a popular choice<sup>1</sup>. This can take several months to heal sufficiently.\r\n\r\nOnce this has been done, the dental implant can begin. First, the oral surgeon will make an incision to open the gum to expose bone. Holes will be drilled into this bone in order to implant metal posts. These posts will serve the role of the tooth root and must be inserted deep into the jaw.\r\n\r\nYou will then be sent away with a gap, or with a temporary removable denture. You will now need to wait until the bone grows back and unites with the surface of the dental implant. This can again take several months but will provide the solid foundations for your new tooth. After this osseointegration process finishes, you will need an additional treatment to insert the abutment: the piece where the crown is attached. This minor surgery will involve a local anaesthesia.\r\n\r\nFinally, you will be able to choose your new artificial teeth which can be screwed and cemented into place, or kept as removable options. You’ll be able to choose the color, material, and location of these new implants.\r\n\r\n## Specific Technologies That Have Lowered Prices\r\n\r\nThere are many steps involved in a dental implant then, but specific technologies have helped to make the process quicker and more affordable.\r\n\r\nFor example, 3D printing and scanning technologies mean that teeth can now be created specifically to fit a patient. This helps to reduce waiting times, while also resulting in a much better fit. It also means that the costs have dropped significantly, as dentists are able to achieve the same result more quickly, easily and affordably<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nIn short, there has never been a better time to get dental implants – and to completely change your smile and your life!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nOver the last few years, developers have been building senior communities in anticipation of the aging baby boomer generation. However, there’s simply too many (especially right now in 2024) which means there is a great deal to be had for you or a loved one. Make sure to check all available offers across senior living communities to make sure you get the best fit for your lifestyle and price that matches your budget!\r\n\r\n## **Drastic Overbuilding Is Common Across the Country**\r\n\r\nDevelopers and senior community development owners have added thousands of new locations across the country in anticipation for the upcoming senior boom. It’s true – soon seniors will make up a large portion of the population as the Baby Boomer generation matures. And, these developers, hoping to capitalize on that increasing need, have built a large number of senior living communities.\r\n\r\nTo take advantage of the aging population, there’s been a significant amount of over-building in senior housing developments throughout the country. That means this surplus of housing options for seniors – many of them with top-of-the-line amenities and spacious designs – is now available and waiting. With so many property options out there, many of these communities have become desperate to fill vacancies just to recoup the money they put into these properties. And, that’s where the true opportunity lies for today’s senior.\r\n\r\n## **What’s the Real Cost of Senior Housing?**\r\n\r\nSome seniors may believe they still can’t afford to invest in a senior living community like this. It’s true it was an expensive transaction at one point. The Department of Health and Human Services states that the average cost of an assisted living facility can range from less than $25,000 a year up to $50,000 a year, depending on location and the amenities available there. Others, including those with limited amenities and basic features, typically cost $8,000 or more, and costs are rising<sup>1</sup>. That could seem like a lot of money for a senior who is on a fixed budget. But, those costs may not be as accurate as they seem going forward.\r\n\r\nRather, there’s a growing number of senior housing vacancies that are putting a financial strain on property owners. These owners need to be able to meet compliance requirements in regards to staffing. They have to maintain their properties in order to attract a senior population with some of the most luxurious of tastes to date. And, they need to entice people into these communities with savings opportunities. All of this adds up to one thing – a significant drop in prices just to fill open rooms.\r\n\r\n## **Now Is the Time to Take Advantage of the Gap**\r\n\r\nIt’s important to see the largest picture here when it comes to senior communities. The National Center for Assisted Living says there are 28,858 communities in the U.S.<sup>2</sup> That seems like a lot of locations, especially when you consider that these locations already house about a million senior citizens right now.\r\n\r\nThe Population Reference Bureau says that the number of Americans over the age of 65 will double from 46 million to 98 million by 2060<sup>3</sup>. This increase is what has encouraged developers to build now. These properties will be necessary within 10 years to keep up with demand. Developers cannot wait until 2030 to start building. They need to do so now.\r\n\r\nHowever, that has created a gap – between what demand is right now and what demand will be in 10 years. Imagine a senior who is 65 years old right now. That person has the ability to fill one of those vacancies with ease. And, in doing so, he or she can take advantage of the amenities at the location, usually enjoying a higher quality of life. However, because these locations are still so limitedly filled, this is also the time to take advantage of affordable prices – long before the rest of the senior population is ready to move into these properties.\r\n\r\n## **Senior Living Deals Are Out There – Now**\r\n\r\nSome areas across the country have already seen an increase in the number of people retiring. This includes areas of California, Arizona, and Colorado. And, some seniors are headed overseas to areas such as Thailand and Malaysia to take advantage of tax-free living. For those remaining here in the U.S. and just thinking about retirement communities, now may be the time to make your move.\r\n\r\nRight now, prices remain competitively low. As demand for senior living communities rises – which we know it will happen as more people age into the population – prices will also increase. For those thinking about making a move, this can be a powerful bargaining tool. It is also possible to find properties in just about any area of the country interested in offering a savings option for you if you plan to move in sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nAs a senior, or soon-to-be-senior, it may be time to start some research to find the next home for your life. With incredible amenities and some areas that are better than expected in terms of features, this is the place to be in the market. For seniors who are likely to wait a few more years, though, expect prices to be a bit higher. If you’re interested in senior living communities that are truly affordable, start your search today.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nAs we reach our later years, life insurance becomes a vital shield, a safeguard against the unexpected, and a way to secure our family’s financial future. Concerns about affordability shouldn't hold you back from getting the right coverage.If you're 50 or older, there are budget-friendly life insurance options waiting for you to explore.\r\n\r\n## Understanding Different Life Insurance Options\r\n\r\nLife insurance mainly comes in two forms: term and permanent.^1^Term insurance covers you for a set period, while permanent insurance lasts a lifetime. By researching these types and their costs, you can select a policy that aligns with your financial plan.\r\n\r\n## Get Life Insurance for $13/Month\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, life insurance can be more economical than perceived. For instance, a healthy 30-year-old woman can get a $250,000 term life insurance policy for around $13 per month, which amounts to just $160 per year.^2^This demonstrates that life insurance can be affordable. Therefore, it's wise to choose your policy sooner rather than later!\r\n\r\n## Exploring Pocket-Friendly Senior Life Insurance Choices\r\n\r\nWhen considering life insurance for seniors, there are several cost-effective options available.

      "content": "\r\nA little over a year into the COVID-19 pandemic and the virus still lingers on. But the CDC has authorized the use of three vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson n Johnson to curb the impact of the virus.\r\n\r\nAccording to NPR<sup>1</sup>, around 64.4 million Americans have been vaccinated with about 171 million doses being administered. That is about 20% of the country’s population. Another research<sup>2</sup>, mentions that around 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated before the virus stops spreading. The country still has a long way to go to reach that mark.\r\n\r\nTo help you understand a bit more about the three vaccines currently being rolled out, we discuss facts and myths around them.\r\n\r\n## Myth: The vaccine can potentially make you sick with COVID-19\r\n\r\n**Fact**: This is probably one of the biggest concerns individuals have with the vaccine, the fact that it can give you the virus. Neither of the three vaccines being administered in the U.S. has the live COVID-19 virus. So, no it will not make you sick with COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThe vaccine, essentially, teaches your immune system how to identify, react, and fight the virus if it enters the body. Some people may experience side effects after taking the vaccine which includes fever but that is part of the vaccination process. Such symptoms show that the immune system is working to protect you and will be ready if you were ever infected.\r\n\r\nImmunity takes time, usually a few weeks. So, you can get infected even after you get vaccinated. That is why you need to continue to wear a mask, wash your hands, be vigilant and remain safe.\r\n\r\nEach of the three vaccines has a different efficacy rate, Pfizer-BioNTech is around 94%, Modern around 90%, and Johnson n Johnson around 72%.\r\n\r\nHowever, all three vaccines will enhance your immune system enough to lower the effectiveness of the virus. The vaccine works to curb the virus so if you are infected after being vaccinated, at most you have minor symptoms and just need to isolate<sup>3</sup>. Hospitalization and death by the virus will virtually be off the table for any individual that has received either of the three vaccines.\r\n\r\n## Myth: You don’t need to get vaccinated if you’ve already had COVID-19\r\n\r\n**Fact**: COVID-19 is still a fairly new virus and experts are still studying it to determine immunity from both the vaccine and after you’ve been infected. Therefore, it is recommended that you get vaccinated even if you’ve had COVID-19 and recovered. It is rare<sup>4</sup> but there have been cases of reinfection.\r\n\r\nBut don’t get the vaccine right away after recovering. Individuals that were directed to use convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies should wait 90 days after recovering before getting vaccinated. The best thing to do is speak to your doctor before getting vaccinated to ensure you are safe to do so.\r\n\r\n## Myth: Developers rushed the COVID-19 vaccine and therefore, we can’t really trust them\r\n\r\n**Fact**: All three vaccines have a high efficacy rate. Studies show that the limited individuals infected after vaccination experienced minor symptoms, none of whom were hospitalized or died.\r\n\r\nThe quick spread of the virus prompted pharmaceuticals to speed up the development process, but they didn’t skip any tests. Instead, they overlapped steps which allowed them to fasten the process of gathering data. Countries were also heavily vested in the whole process, which meant developers had all the resources needed to create effective vaccines in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n## Myth: The vaccine will alter your DNA\r\n\r\n**Fact**: All three vaccines are effective because they result in the development of spike protein to protect against the virus. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have the instructions on an mRNA while Johnson n Johnson uses double-stranded DNA. This has caused a lot of chatter about the vaccines altering an individual’s DNA.\r\n\r\nThe mRNA in the vaccine consisting of the instructions just provides cells the guidance on how to develop the spike protein that will render the virus useless against the cell. The mRNA does not get into the central part of the cell where the DNA is present, hence, it doesn’t form any type of alteration or mutation.\r\n\r\n## Myth: There are long-term side effects to the vaccine\r\n\r\n**Fact**: The side effects of any vaccine usually occur immediately after taking it. If you don’t experience any side effects within 30 minutes to a few hours after the vaccine, you are in the clear.\r\n\r\nThe most severe side effects of the vaccine would be due to allergic reactions. If you aren’t sure of any allergies, consult your doctor before you get vaccinated.\r\n\r\n## Myth: The COVID-19 vaccine is dangerous for people with underlying problems, therefore they shouldn’t get vaccinated\r\n\r\n**Fact**: The impact of COVID-19 on people with an underlying problem such as heart disease and diabetes is likely to be more severe than those without it. Therefore, such individuals should be the first to be vaccinated. When vaccination opened up, the elderly and people with underlying problems were the first to be administered the vaccine.\r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns or doubts about the vaccine due to your underlying problem, consult your doctor. They can help clarify all of your concerns.\r\n\r\n## Myth: The COVID-19 vaccine can lead to infertility or miscarriage\r\n\r\n**Fact**: There is a lot of information being circulated that the spike protein produced by the vaccine binds to the placental proteins, which results in infertility. You will find such information on forums that are anti-vaccine.\r\n\r\nThe logic behind the reasoning of infertility and miscarriage is not scientifically plausible. The vaccine in no way leads to either<sup>5</sup>. Studies were conducted on COVID-19 infected, pregnant women to see its impact on them. In response to the virus, the immune system itself produces the spike protein. There were no instances in which these women experienced a miscarriage or it affected their fertility.\r\n\r\n## Myth: Pregnant women should not be vaccinated\r\n\r\n**Fact**: Yes, there is limited data in terms of the impact of the vaccine on pregnant women since they weren’t included in the trials. However, getting the vaccine is a personal choice and the vaccine itself doesn’t contain any content that would be harmful to them.\r\n\r\nThe reason why CDC has left this as a personal choice of the individual is that the virus has severe effects on pregnant women, usually leading to hospitalization. CDC does request pregnant women who opt for the vaccine to register for their v-safe pregnancy registry. This is a voluntary program that has personalized health check-ins post-vaccination.\r\n\r\n## Myth: You don’t need to wear a mask or follow CDC guidelines for COVID-19 vaccination\r\n\r\n**Fact**: As previously mentioned, experts are still gathering data on the effectiveness of the vaccine in terms of immunity from the virus. We already know they aren’t 100% effective but do reduce the impact if infected. There is still not enough data to determine if vaccinated individuals can still carry and transmit the virus, that too without showing symptoms. So, until more data is collected, experts recommend you still follow preventative guidelines to halt the spread of the virus even after being vaccinated.\r\n\r\nVaccination is vital as countries move to develop herd immunity. The three vaccines currently being administered in the U.S. are safe. But to be on the safe side, you should consult your doctor before getting vaccinated. They can tell you what to expect and whether it is safe for you.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nCOVID has impacted every aspect of our lives. For those trying to complete their education, it has become even harder. Many of the most prestigious colleges and universities have seen significant drops in enrollment numbers. In an attempt to continue to provide students with the best possible education, many have started to offer online degree programs for students who are interested in enrolling. The benefits of this type of learning are extensive and are opening many doors for students who may not have considered attending the school otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Added Convenience\r\n\r\nOnline degree programs offer a level of convenience that on-campus classes don’t. There is no commute to and from class. Students can attend from almost anywhere and if they are already employed, can continue to work their regular schedule. Online courses also provide additional resources students can refer back to if they have questions or are looking for suggestions on how to complete an assignment. The online learning platform makes it easy for them to communicate with faculty members or find out when assignments are due.\r\n\r\n## Less Anxiety\r\n\r\nFor many students, attending a classroom can lead to higher than normal anxiety levels. Constant distractions can make it difficult for them to focus on their studies. Being able to attend the school of their choice using an online learning platform makes it easier for them to retain the information they are learning. They can focus on their assignments with limited distractions and commit themselves fully to their studies. Students who are known to have anxiety can often stay motivated much easier when using an online format because they feel at ease.\r\n\r\n## Valuable Resources\r\n\r\nAs more and more of the highly recognized universities and colleges begin to offer online degree programs, they are also providing more online resources as well. This allows students to have many of the same advantages as the students who are enrolled in classroom degree programs. While they may not be able to attend the school’s library, much of the learning material they will need can be found online or by accessing the student portal. These valuable resources allow them to share the same overall learning experience, only at a distance.\r\n\r\n## Safer for At-Risk Students\r\n\r\nEven with social distancing and the use of masks and other PPE, there are several students who are considered to be at a higher risk than others. Students who have chronic illnesses or are taking certain types of medication must be very careful about where they go and who they meet. Being able to attend the school of their choice, especially if it is one of the more prestigious ones, is a dream come true for many. Many of the online degree programs are held in conjunction with traditional classroom sessions so students can feel as if they are in the classroom even though they are safe at home. Students who are at risk are finding it much easier to attend school now that COVID has forced the issue of online learning programs.\r\n\r\n## Accredited Degree Programs\r\n\r\nPrestigious colleges and universities are offering online degree programs that are accredited both regionally and in specialty areas. This ensures students will get the best possible education from schools and programs that exceed industry standards. It also means that the course has been thoroughly evaluated to ensure that each student is getting the most advanced and up-to-date information possible. They will have everything they need to graduate and feel confident they can accomplish any goal. Accreditation on both the specialty and regional level is an ongoing achievement that many schools of higher learning are committed to. It shows their willingness to ensure the success of their students.\r\n\r\n## Begin Your Search For An Online Degree Now\r\n\r\nDue to COVID-19, many of the most highly-respected universities and colleges in the country are opening their doors, or online portals, to students who want to attend their degree programs. They receive the same quality education and resources as on-campus students and are able to utilize every asset and resource the school has to offer. Students can choose the school of their dreams that they may not have otherwise been able to attend. The COVID pandemic has changed many things about how colleges and universities are handling their online degree programs. Opening their enrollment to online students is making it possible for more and more students to enroll in the most prestigious schools in the country.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nGroundbreaking treatment options are now being used to keep psoriasis under control and effectively manage its symptoms. Psoriasis is different in each individual. What works for you may not work for others. For many people, it can take months of trial and error before finding the right combination of treatment options for both scalp psoriasis and plaque psoriasis.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1080x1080_psoriasis_elbow_applyincream.jpg)</div><div class=\"cta-textcover\">Best Treatment for Psoriasis <city></city></div>](#)</div>Psoriasis is most often characterized by reddened patches of skin covered by whitish scales that flake away as the skin dries out. It is a chronic, auto-immune disorder¹ that affects the surface layers of the skin. Psoriasis causes the body to produce skin cells too quickly. The cells do not have enough time to live out their month-long cycle before more cells appear to take their place. This thick build-up of cells causes itching, redness, and the dry-scaling appearance.\r\n\r\n## Light Therapy\r\n\r\nUVA and UVB lights have been successfully used to control overactive white cells that damage healthier skin cells. While sunlight is the best form of light therapy, using UVA and UVB sources² will provide similar effects. Using this type of treatment on a regular basis will minimize your symptoms, especially if your condition is mild to moderate. Your doctor can work with you to set up a schedule that will control rapid cell growth and keep your skin looking and feeling as healthy as possible. Everyone responds differently to light therapy. Using both natural and manufactured forms of lighting is one of the most effective ways to get the best possible results.\r\n\r\n## Medications\r\n\r\nOver the years, many medications have been formulated that also provide relief from the symptoms of psoriasis. Retinoids, biologics, and medications like cyclosporin and methotrexate are systemic medications that work throughout the body. While these medications are effective, they may have unpleasant side effects. They are not ideal for long-term use but can be very beneficial if used for short periods of time. When psoriasis flares up, it’s important to be able to get it under control as quickly as possible. System medications are the best way to accomplish this. Once you get the condition back to a manageable state, topical treatment options can then be used to minimize the inflammation and discomfort.\r\n\r\n## Topical Treatment Options\r\n\r\nTopical treatment options³ are applied directly to the affected areas and provide almost immediate relief from the itching and discomfort caused by psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids and retinoids are beneficial in relieving the itching and inflammation associated with psoriasis. Moisturizers that contain salicylic acid and Vitamin D also work well and keeps the skin from drying out and flaking uncontrollably. Because psoriasis can appear almost anywhere on the body, the use of topical treatments is a great way to keep symptoms under control and easy to manage. Topical treatments have fewer side effects and can often be applied as needed, unless they are a prescription that requires specific instructions. Your doctor will be able to help you in choosing the right ones.\r\n\r\n## Lifestyle Changes\r\n\r\nThe biggest factors that affect psoriasis and how it works in the body have to do with your lifestyle and environment. Stress is a huge factor in the severity of psoriasis outbreaks. When your body is under stress, you may not get enough sleep and your diet tends to suffer. The key is making simple lifestyle changes that will allow your body to function in a healthy manner. Do your best to minimize your stress and be more mindful of your sleep patterns. Include fresh foods that support your skin and connective tissues. Keep a journal to identify when your psoriasis is most active and what lifestyle habits or traits are present at that time. Make a few adjustments to see if you can bring your condition under control without the use of harsh medications.\r\n\r\nPatients who have a severe form of the condition will benefit most from using several treatment options. Learning how to effectively manage stress and living a healthier lifestyle is most beneficial. Include foods rich in Vitamin A and D that support healthy skin and will give your body what it needs to function as efficiently as possible. Psoriasis does not have to control your life. With proper treatment and a few healthy lifestyle changes, you can manage your symptoms and have a higher quality of life. Talk to your doctor about the new treatment options that are being made available to people with psoriasis. You may be surprised at how easy it is to take your life back!\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nIndividuals with diabetes now have more options than ever before when it comes to keeping their condition under control. From minimally invasive procedures to simple lifestyle changes, people are learning how easy it is to effectively manage their Type 2 diabetes. Today’s technology allows for many more effective treatment options to be considered.\r\n\r\nIn the past, there were only a few proven methods patients could confidently use to manage the symptoms they experienced. But now, people who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes can find treatment options that work best for their individual diagnosis. Working with their doctor will allow them to try different options to see which one (or two) works best for them.\r\n\r\n## DMR or Duodenal Mucosal Resurfacing\r\n\r\nDMR, or duodenal mucosal resurfacing¹ is a new technique that provides similar results to those offered by bariatric bypass surgery. By ablating the cells under the first layer of mucosal duodenal tissue, the resulting change in the tissues alters how the body utilizes glucose and gives you back some degree of control over your blood sugar levels. Not only does it affect blood glucose levels, it also helps in weight management as well. The procedure is less invasive than traditional bariatric bypass surgery and gives you the option to control your diabetes in a safe and effective manner.\r\n\r\n## New Oral Medications\r\n\r\nNew oral medications are being developed every year that work to halt the progression of diabetes and keep your symptoms under control. Many oral medications are able to help you maintain your diabetes for several years as long as you continue to follow dietary recommendations, exercise regularly, and live a healthy lifestyle. Understanding your symptoms and how your body functions are essential. No two individuals are alike in how their body handles disease or responds to specific medications. Take the time to learn about your own health and take the appropriate measures.\r\n\r\n## Injectable Options\r\n\r\nWhile insulin is the most well-known of the injectables², diabetic patients now have other options to choose from. Amylin Analogue and GLP-1 agonists are both used to minimize the amount of insulin you need. Amylin analogue works for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, while GLP-1 agonists are only for patients with Type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 agonists work primarily by encouraging your body to release the insulin it needs when your blood sugar levels are elevated. When it comes to Type 2 diabetes treatment options, most people would prefer to avoid the injectables.\r\n\r\n## Changes in Diet and the Use of Supplements\r\n\r\nHunger cravings and an increase in thirst are two common symptoms of diabetes. For many people who have just been diagnosed with diabetes, altering their diet can go to great lengths to reverse many of their diabetic symptoms and bring their blood sugar levels back under control. Adding nutritional supplements³ like chromium and ginseng may also be beneficial. Before including any type of natural supplement, however, consult with your doctor to ensure there are no other contraindications to consider.\r\n\r\n## Exercise and Other Forms of Physical Activity\r\n\r\nExercise burns calories. It also lowers blood glucose levels. The foods you eat are turned into blood glucose in two ways. Simple sugars are converted rather quickly and provide an almost immediate boost of energy. Complex carbohydrates and proteins take much longer to breakdown and provide sustained levels of energy over longer periods of time. The blood sugar that isn’t used is eventually stored as fat that the body can burn off as needed when other sources of energy are depleted. Exercise and other forms of strenuous physical activity play a vital role in keeping the symptoms of diabetes under control.\r\n\r\n</div>Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes require significant lifestyle changes if you expect to keep them under control. With all of the latest advancements in diabetes treatment options, patients are able to effectively manage their disease in a way that is the best for them. Even individuals with advanced forms of the disease now have multiple diabetes treatment options to choose from, many of which given them a higher quality of life and a longer life expectancy. By working hand in hand with your doctor, you will be able to identify which diabetes treatment options will work best for you and your unique situation.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has people more conscious of their health than ever before. So much so that even the slightest bit of cough has them paranoid, thinking they might have caught the virus.\r\n\r\nAs people focus more on their general health, they tend to overlook oral health. There is no denying that your oral health is linked to your overall health. While ensuring good oral health doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t catch the virus, it does reduce the risk of other health problems such as heart disease<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nMost dental clinics were closed during the pandemic, only entertaining emergency cases. The key to taking care of your mouth during the pandemic is to ensure you take preventative measures. While you can’t go to your dentist for a regular checkup, you can take steps at home to ensure you maintain good oral health. We highlight exactly how you can do that.\r\n\r\n## Make the switch to an electric toothbrush\r\n\r\nThe best way to fight plaque is to prevent it. Manual toothbrushes do a decent job at stopping plaque but that is only if you brush with the right force and for two minutes. Electric toothbrushes make the brushing process easier for you. A lot of the options come equipped with a timer and oscillate at a rapid speed. The vibration and force at which the brush oscillates dislodges food debris and particles in your mouth, leaving you with a cleaner mouth.\r\n\r\nStudies have shown that electric toothbrushes do a better job at preventing plaque when compared to their manual counterparts<sup>2</sup>. Keep in mind that the brush won’t remove plaque altogether, for that you would need to see your dentist. The brush just helps prevent further formation of plaque around your teeth and in the gums. Protecting you from various oral problems from cavities to gum disease.\r\n\r\n## Be mindful of what you eat\r\n\r\nDiet has been somewhat of a concern for most people during the pandemic. The past year has been stressful which has resulted in excessive snacking for many, as a way to deal with the stress.\r\n\r\nJunk food and sugary drinks develop certain acids in your mouth, which target the surface of your teeth. The more exposure your teeth have to the acid, the weaker they become. You want to limit your intake of any food that is high in starch, sugar, or non-fiber carbohydrates. They not only leave your teeth vulnerable to bacteria but also promote plaque.\r\n\r\nBesides, junk food, you also want to limit smoking and drinking alcohol. Smoking has detrimental effects on your gums, inhibiting its blood supply which puts you at risk of gum disease. While alcohol dehydrates your mouth leaving it dry. The dryness gives way for bacteria to easily multiply and colonize in your mouth leading to plaque and cavities.\r\n\r\nYou want a diet that focuses on fruits, lots of green vegetables, and water. There is no better time than now to drink as much water as you can. Not only does water promote your overall health but also oral health. It increases the production of saliva, which fights bacteria, and also hydrates your mouth so bacteria have trouble flourishing in it.\r\n\r\n## Follow a strict oral care routine\r\n\r\nBrushing your teeth and flossing should be part of your daily routine. There is no way around it. If you want good oral health, you need to brush twice a day and floss at least once.\r\n\r\n- **Brushing**: You need to brush for 2 minutes, twice a day. Brushing for less than two minutes usually results in you not thoroughly covering the surfaces of your teeth, leaving them vulnerable to plaque. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste with fluoride. When brushing, use a circular motion and make sure you brush your tongue along with your teeth.\r\n- **Flossing**: Toothbrushes are incapable of getting in between your teeth, which means they can’t remove any particles lodged there. Dental floss cleans between the teeth, preventing plaque from forming. If you are uncomfortable using floss, you can use an oral irrigation device such as a Waterpik.\r\n\r\nAlong with brushing and flossing, you should also consider rinsing your mouth with a mouthwash. It contains antiseptic that kill harmful bacteria in your mouth. When paired with brushing and flossing, mouthwash serves as another line of defense against the millions of harmful bacteria, limiting their ability to multiply.\r\n\r\n## Seek dental assistance in cases of emergency\r\n\r\nBoth ADA and CDC recommended that dental clinics close down for the public and only serve patients that have emergencies. States such as NY even prohibited clinics from performing any nonemergency services such as exams, fillings, cleaning, and aesthetic work.\r\n\r\nThis prompted a lot of dentists to turn to telemedicine. Which allowed them to continue to counsel patients through video conferencing or phone. Many dentists prefer video conferencing since it is easier to assess the degree of emergency when they can examine the mouth. For most pain, dentists will likely recommend over-the-counter pain relievers. However, in serious cases when the pain is unbearable, extraction is needed, or infected gums a dentist grants an appointment to further examine to determine the best course of action.\r\n\r\nThe restriction on dental clinics has been lifted in many states with the vaccine being rolled out. You still want to be careful and limit going to the dentist and out in general. But you can go for regular checkups and other procedures. Just make sure you take safety measures when you do visit.\r\n\r\n## How you can take care of oral problems on your own\r\n\r\nFor those that have on-going oral problems, it may be difficult to seek treatment unless it is an emergency.\r\n\r\n### Protecting yourself from tooth decay\r\n\r\nThere is no better way than brushing twice a day and flossing when it comes to preventing plaque and cavities that can lead to tooth decay. The toothpaste you use plays a vital role. Use toothpaste with fluoride, the mineral has enamel building characteristics, which ensure healthy teeth<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nIndividuals that experience dry mouth are at more risk of developing cavities and tooth decay. Fluoride toothpaste may not be enough. For at-home treatment, a mouth rinse or fluoride gel is the best option. But consult your dentist virtually before you opt for such a solution.\r\n\r\n### Preventing gum disease\r\n\r\nSince it’s difficult to visit your dentist for your annual checkup, your gums become vulnerable to plaque. Once plaque forms inside your gums, it is difficult to remove it by just brushing and flossing. You need to get your teeth and gums professionally cleaned.\r\n\r\nA good oral care routine does help prevent plaque and keeps it at bay. So, if you can’t see your dentist, you need to make sure you brush twice a day and floss at least once<sup>4</sup>. This will protect your teeth and limit the damaging effects of plaque, for those that already have it. You also need to make sure you have a well-balanced diet and quit smoking.\r\n\r\n### Treating dry mouth\r\n\r\nA dry mouth is a result of your mouth not producing enough saliva. It may not seem like a problem at first but it increases the chances of cavities, infection, and tooth decay.\r\n\r\nDrinking alcohol, smoking, and medication for depression and high blood pressure often lead to dry mouth. While you should consult your dentist to see if you need any specific treatment, most will tell you to drink more water and sugarless drinks. Water ensures your mouth stays hydrated and promotes saliva production.\r\n\r\nOne year into the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to adjust to the “new” norm. However, that doesn’t mean you put your oral health at risk. Be sure to consult your dentist as often as you like, amid virtually. All dentists continue to be available to patients and can help you prevent oral problems and maintain good oral health.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nHealth insurance is something that everyone should have, no matter what age. Whereas some people feel that they don’t need to worry about such things as they got older, that actually couldn’t be further from the truth!\r\n\r\nThe older you become, the more important health insurance becomes. Unfortunately, risk of countless illnesses and conditions increases as you age, and so it’s crucial to ensure that you’re able to prepare for that. In this post, you’ll learn how to prepare for old age while looking after your health.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/health-ins-facts.jpg)Here are the top health insurance facts seniors need to know.\r\n\r\n## Health Insurance Gets More Expensive\r\n\r\nOne reason some seniors are reluctant to sign up for health insurance, is that it gets more expensive. That’s for the reason we outlined above: as you get older, you’re more likely to _need_ that health insurance! That makes you a less profitable gambit for insurance companies, which in turn makes them less likely to want to insure you.\r\n\r\nWhile this is true, there are many things you can do to reduce your premiums and become more appealing for those companies. Then there’s the fact that once you turn 65, you’ll be able to sign up for Medicare. Instead of burying your head in the sand and ignoring it, it’s crucial that you be proactive about protecting yourself.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the methods for insuring yourself for less revolve around improving your health and fitness. For example, if you quit smoking then this will likely result in an immediate drop in the cost of your insurance. And the good news is that you can check out our article on how to do that here.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you currently have a dangerous job, then this can impact on the cost of your insurance. Other factors are outside of your control (such as family history of disease), but you can actually reduce your insurance bill by shopping around: different companies are better suited to different circumstances and individuals.\r\n\r\n## A Bit About Medicare\r\n\r\nMedicare is made up of four separate parts:\r\n\r\n- Part A – Covers hospital costs\r\n- Part B – Covers routine care (visits from a physician, for example)\r\n- Part C – Medicare Advantage Program (Bundles Part A, B and sometimes D into one plan)\r\n- Part D – Prescription drugs\r\n\r\nIf you are enrolled in Social Security, then you will be automatically enrolled into Medicare. However, if you aren’t currently receiving Social Security and you don’t manually sign up for Medicare by the age of 65, you will potentially need to pay more for the same services. Part B premiums actually go up by 10% each year that you fail to sign up!\r\n\r\nYou can actually sign up three months prior to turning 65 (and three months after). The sooner you sign up, the less likely you are to experience a gap in your insurance and the less likely you are to end up paying more.\r\n\r\n## Not Everything is Covered by Medicare\r\n\r\nYou also need to make sure you carefully read all the small print surrounding your Medicare cover. That’s because not everything will be covered, and you may risk falling through the gaps if you aren’t careful.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Part A will cover 100% of hospitalization costs (after the deductible) but only for 60 days. After that point, you’ll need to pay a share of the cost, and this will go up to 100% after 90 days. This is a reason you may still decide to take other forms of insurance.\r\n\r\nLikewise, some medications won’t be covered by Part D, and Part B will require a monthly premium.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to research Medicare thoroughly and read the fine print, then decide whether you still want to take out additional insurance.\r\n\r\n## Types of Senior Health Insurance\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different types of senior health insurance providers that you can look into, should you decide you wish to<sup>2</sup>. These include:\r\n\r\n- Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs): These plans require you to receive all of your medical care from a particular health care provider in your area (with the exception of medical emergencies). This means you won’t be able to choose your preferred hospital or healthcare visitor, so you need to research the facilities that are included near you.\r\n- Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO): These plans let you choose your own doctors and organizations, as the name suggests. You’ll pay more as a result.\r\n- Point-Of-Service Organizations: This is a scenario where your primary care physician will manage your care. You can choose additional hospitals and doctors outside of that network, but you’ll need to pay more.\r\n\r\nSome insurers will include Medicare Advantage in their plans, while some employers and organizations may offer insurance already. Certain types of life insurance also include health insurance too, and there may be some areas where this overlaps.\r\n\r\nIn short, you need to ensure that you conduct thorough research before you decide on the best option for you.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nAs you reach your senior years, the likelihood that you will need expensive medical care increases. This is something none of us like to think about, and so in many cases _we don’t_. Rather than face our mortality, we would rather bury our heads in the sand and hope that everything turns out okay. But as with many things, it is far better to have medical insurance and not need it than it is to need it and not have it! In fact, the latter can lead to extreme levels of discomfort, pain, embarrassment, and poverty. This should be your absolute priority, and Medigap is one of the key things you need to think about as you reach your late 60s.\r\n\r\n## About Medicare\r\n\r\n[So just what is Medigap](https://google.com)? In order to understand precisely what this is, it’s important to first understand Medicare.\r\n\r\nMedicare is a product offered by the federal government to ensure that older individuals can afford the healthcare they need to live healthy, happy, dignified lives. If you are 65 and over and you are currently enrolled in social security, then you will automatically be placed on Medicare.\r\n\r\n(If you are not on social security then you will need to sign up manually for Medicare, and failure to do so will result in your paying more for the same service. You can sign up to three months prior to turning 65, and up to three months after.)\r\n\r\nMedicare will then provide basic coverage for a number of medical expenses. The program is split into four parts, with each part representing a different aspect of the cover<sup>1</sup>. These are:\r\n\r\n- Part A – Covers hospital costs\r\n- Part B – Covers routine care (visits from a physician, for example)\r\n- Part C – Medicare Advantage Program (Bundles Part A, B and sometimes D into one plan)\r\n- Part D – Prescription drugs\r\n\r\n## Medicare: What’s Missing\r\n\r\nWhat’s also important in order to understand Medigap, is to look at what is missing from Medicare. The answer is that Medicare does not provide comprehensive cover for every eventuality that might affect the older population.\r\n\r\nFor example, although Part A covers hospital costs, this does not include 100% of all possible costs. Medicare will pay for hospital fees for 60 days (2 months) and following this, it will then be necessary for the patient to provide some of the funds. What’s more, is that once the patient has been in hospital for 90 days, the amount they are required to pay will increase to 100%. This is something that many people with serious illnesses simply won’t be able to manage.\r\n\r\nPart B likewise will require monthly payments, while not all medication will be covered by part C. Medicare also does not include such things as medical alert systems, which can be an oversight for seniors that need these devices.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that Medicare doesn’t help with hospice care. This can be a serious consideration for seniors that struggle with mobility, or with memory issues. Medicaid _does_ offer this however<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nMedicaid is a similar program provided by a combination of the state and federal government that targets low income individuals, children, and others. Not everyone who is eligible for Medicare will also be eligible for Medicaid, but those that are may wish to consider getting both types of cover.\r\n\r\nFor everyone else, there is a third option: Medigap.\r\n\r\n## What is Medigap?\r\n\r\nMedigap is essentially a type of health insurance that specifically provides the missing elements of Medicare. Also called Medicare Supplement Insurance<sup>3</sup>, this ensures that you are covered for all the things that are not included in Medicare. This makes it easier for you to take out additional insurance for a complete coverage, but without worrying about “double dipping” and wasting money by paying for the same coverage twice.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind though, that Medigap policies still won’t cover every single eventuality. Often for instance, Medigap policies won’t include long-term care, vision, or dental care. Likewise, they won’t include hearing aids, eyeglasses, or private-duty nursing.\r\n\r\nThat said, some Medigap policies _will_ include these things, so it’s worth reading the policies and terms thoroughly in order to ensure you are covered for everything you need. Ultimately, it is your decision to think about how much you want to spend per month on your premiums, and just how much cover you need in exchange for that expense.\r\n\r\nSome things to keep in mind about Medigap:\r\n\r\n- To apply for Medigap, you must have both Part A and Part B Medicare\r\n- Medigap policies are different from Medicare Advantage Plans. Some of those plans are also provided by third party insurances.\r\n- It is illegal for anyone to sell you a Medigap policy if you already have a Medicare Advantage Plan.\r\n- You will pay a monthly premium to the private insurance company for your Medigap policy.\r\n\r\nHopefully this article has provided you with some useful information regarding Medigap and where it fits into your medical insurance plan. It’s time to do some thinking, and to choose the best option for you. Just remember: health is THE most important thing you can invest in.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nLosing your hair can be a highly distressing feeling and one that brings you a lot of stress. Losing hair can damage your self-image, your confidence and more. In short it’s something that most people want to reverse, delay, or at least cover up when it happens. Unfortunately, many of us equate a head of luscious hair with youthful vigor and energy. When we start receding, we see it as the beginning of the end, and a constant reminder of our mortality. Thankfully, there are options – and they’re more affordable than they ever have been!\r\n\r\n## ![](/posts/Hair-loss.jpg)Hair Loss Options Are Now Cheaper Than Ever Before\r\n\r\nHair loss options include the likes of hair implants, hair extensions, grafting and more. Any of these can restore a full head of hair, with varying degrees of success. The great news is that these options are also cheaper than ever before – which means that they are also available to _more people_ than ever before.\r\n\r\nWhy is this? One key reason is that the technology has been around for a while. When any new technology hits the market, it will be expensive to begin with. This can be due to the fact that it is new, and therefore desirable. Most likely, the technology is not yet refined, which means that it will take more work and time. Moreover, the technology won’t have been picked up by competitors yet, meaning that the supply is low and demand is high. Another reason hair loss technology is more expensive when it was first introduced, is that the solutions are very often patented. Patents ensure that only one company is able to carry out the procedure, such that the company is able to profit from its unique intellectual property. However, patents only last for ten years, at which point competitors are able to mimic the technique, driving prices down.\r\n\r\nHair transplants, grafts, and more have all been around for a while now and as such, they are more affordable and widely available than ever before!\r\n\r\n## Signs You’re Losing Your Hair\r\n\r\nBut do you even need to worry?\r\n\r\nThere are several different ways that we can lose hair and the pattern can vary in different circumstances. For instance, for some men, hair will literally fall out and fail to grow back. This tends to be a slightly more rapid form of hair loss, and will result in bald patches relatively quickly. In some cases, certain disorders can cause your hair to come out in ‘clumps’ so that you have bald patches around your head just in particular patches. Many people will choose to shave their hair or get hair loss treatments in these cases as although they still have a lot of their hair, the gaps make it look unusual and mean that they can’t create the looks and styles they would want to. If you wake up in the morning and you find that you have hair on your pillow, or if it starts coming out in the shower or when you brush, then these are signs you may be losing your hair.\r\n\r\nSometimes people will find that their hair thins out rather than falls out and that their hair begins to feel more wispy. This is how women tend to thin out on top, but it can equally happen to men. If this is the case, then you may be able to strengthen your hair with a number of hair loss products so this is something worth identifying. You can that way rely on expensive shampoos and treatments rather than paying for hair loss options.\r\n\r\nYou may also find that your hairline is receding and this is another common way for men to lose their hair. Here you will notice that your forehead seems to get larger as your hair moves further and further back across your scalp. Certain haircuts can lessen the impact of this such as a buzz cut or a faux mohawk, though some men will choose hair loss treatments to restore the hair they’ve lost.\r\n\r\nShaving your hair very shot is a good way to accept defeat graciously. It may be less acceptable for women though, and for men it will still be apparent where the hair line is.\r\n\r\n## Hair Loss Options\r\n\r\nOnce you have identified the need for a hair loss treatment, the next step is to identify the correct one for you. There are a number of different hair loss treatments to choose from<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n**Hair Implants**: Hair implants are an invasive and painful procedure that involve literally sewing new hair into your head. This process results in a permanent hair replacement however that you can treat as your own hair and that will never fall out. That said, it is also not the most versatile of hair options and it does have its limitations. It means for instance you can never restyle your hair because it won’t grow back, and normally the hair is synthetic meaning that it won’t respond well to curling or straightening. Perhaps a better option is to use hair implants, then to shave the hair very close to the scalp for a more gracious way to hide your hair loss.\r\n\r\n**Grafting:** A hair graft is also known as a hair transplant. This works by taking hair from one area to another. This may mean moving hair from a thicker area of hair on the scalp, or it might mean using hair from other parts of the body. This tends to work better where the patient is experiencing patchiness in their hair, as of course the “supply” is limited. Keep in mind that patchiness is likely to continue to get worse over time, meaning that this could be a short-term solution<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\n**Hair Extensions:** Hair extension is a great way to disguise hair loss. With hair extensions you get more hair clipped into your hair or bonded to it chemically in order to give it more length. This then can enable you to make your hair look thicker and to cover up bald spots, and because you can use real human hair in some cases this will act and appear just as normal hair. You’ll need to get the procedure done at least every four months though, and it will only work if you already have _some_ hair to work with.\r\n\r\n**Wigs:** Wigs are the next step up from hair extensions. These are not as tightly secured or natural looking as hair extensions, but at the same time they enable you to try out a lot of fun hairstyles and to alter your look immediately whatever the status of your existing hair. This then is a fun way to make the most of hair loss, but can be a little hard work as you try to avoid letting the wig blow off or slip. Make sure you choose the wig well, and again the best options are human hair wigs which look very natural comparatively.\r\n\r\n**Medication:** Rogaine (minoxidil) and Propecia (finasteride) are the only FDA-approved drugs to treat pattern baldness. While this is a non-invasive procedure, it is only effective in certain cases. Rogaine (a topical solution) has a success rate of around 10-14%, though it is more successful in slowing down the rate of hair loss. Propecia is a pill that is somewhat effective in slowing hair loss in men.\r\n\r\n**PRP**: PRP is Platelet-rich Plasma, which can be extracted from the patient’s blood and then reinserted into areas of hair loss to help repair blood vessels and collagen production. The cost varies from $500-$1,000 per session and can take up to 2 years of regular visits.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nRegardless of why you need an attorney, it’s important that you find an affordable and reputable one. Attorneys are held to extremely high standards, but that doesn’t always mean that _any_ attorney will be able to represent you well. Some attorneys specialize in certain areas — such as personal liability, estate law, or business law — while other attorneys may have a more general practice. Attorneys exist on a fairly wide spectrum so how can you make sure you’re getting the highest quality and lowest cost option? You have to begin your search to compare all attorneys in your area.\r\n\r\nSpecialization matters. You can start by asking for referrals from friends and family members, but you need to know the type of attorney you need. Do you need a criminal attorney? Or a divorce attorney? Some attorneys specialize in different things, but they will rarely take cases outside their specialization. No attorney can know everything about everything, and you need the best attorney possible to represent you.\r\n\r\nWhat if no one you know is able to recommend an attorney? You can go through your local bar association.\r\n\r\nYour bar association will have a website that lists everyone currently registered with the bar. In other words, all active attorneys in your area. You can search by specialization and start calling around for a consultation. Most attorneys will have a nominal consultation fee or even a free consultation. If your budget is a concern, you can continue to call around until you find someone who might offer a free consultation or who may operate on a sliding scale.\r\n\r\nBut just knowing who your attorney options are doesn’t mean you’re finding the best one.\r\n\r\n## Getting an Attorney Within Your Budget\r\n\r\nBudget matters a lot when choosing an attorney.\r\n\r\nYou might think that you’re only going through a process that will take a few months. But it’s possible a legal action could take much longer. Every step takes time and money. And the money accrues.\r\n\r\nBe realistic about how much you can spend on an attorney. Talk to your attorney about options. Some have sliding scales and others have payment plans. You should call around to multiple attorneys and get quotes from them.\r\n\r\nUsually, when you get an attorney, you will need to first place a retainer. You will then need to pay for anything outside of that retainer. Ask about the retainer amount as well as the estimates they have for the case, but understand that these are just estimates; no one can truly know how long a case will take or how much effort will be spent.\r\n\r\nIf you have very little budget, you may want to see a local charity. Sometimes non-profit organizations work with legal aid pro bono and there are low income legal aid attorneys available.\r\n\r\nThere are some situations in which it’s expected you may not have liquidity. Bankruptcy attorneys often see this as do divorce attorneys. In the case of a divorce, it’s known that you may not have access to cash until the divorce is completed; that means that you’re going to have to have an attorney work on contingency until the situation is resolved.\r\n\r\n## Making Sure Your Attorney is Reputable\r\n\r\nHow do you know whether your attorney is trustworthy?\r\n\r\nYour first step can be to look online. Look for reviews and testimonials. A single bad review isn’t the end of the world. It’s possible the attorney just rubbed someone the wrong way or had a bad outcome through no fault of their own. But if a lot of people are complaining, that’s a bad sign.\r\n\r\nLook out for people who say that they were billed far more than they thought they would be, or that they found it difficult to get in contact with their attorney. Look for complaints against the firm on the Better Business Bureau. Don’t be afraid to ask your attorney if there are specific bad reviews that concern you. They should be able to explain.\r\n\r\n</div>While it may seem like going through a lot of steps, it’s absolutely essential you find the right attorney.\r\n\r\nOften, whether your case goes well or poorly is going to depend on the skill of your attorney. Your attorney needs to know the relevant laws inside and out and needs to be able to represent you with confidence.\r\n\r\nBut as long as you do the legwork, check their reviews and testimonials., and otherwise make sure that they communicate well with you, you should be able to find a solid attorney near you.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nMedicare is a form of health insurance available from the federal government. Its job is to provide those who are 65 and older with a built-in level of care, covering a number of different services. But while Medicare can be a powerful service, it can also be confusing for those just starting out. In this post, we’re going to take a look at the benefits of Medicare, the negatives, which type is right for you: basically, everything you need to know.\r\n\r\nMedicare is available to those that are 65 or older, as well as certain individuals with specific disabilities, and those with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD – a form of kidney failure that requires dialysis or transplant)<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Medicare-1024x682.jpg)Most people using Medicare will fall into the over 65’s camp however, and so that is the group we will be focussing on here.\r\n\r\n## The Basics: Parts\r\n\r\nMedicare is split into four separate parts:\r\n\r\n- Part A – Covers hospital costs\r\n- Part B – Covers routine care (visits from a physician, for example)\r\n- Part C – Medicare Advantage Program (Bundles Part A, B and sometimes D into one plan)\r\n- Part D – Prescription drugs\r\n\r\nWhile this may sound somewhat comprehensive, it’s important to recognize that this is not an entirely comprehensive solution and there are some limitations.\r\n\r\nFor example, Part A insurance will only pay 100% of your hospital costs for up to 60 days (around two months). After this point, you will then need to pay a share of the cost. After 90 days, you will be required to pay 100% of the costs.\r\n\r\nWhile this won’t be an issue in most cases, some illnesses can require ongoing care for many months, and this can become expensive if you only have Medicare.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Part D will only cover certain medications, meaning that you may still have to pay for certain things. Part B also requires monthly premiums, meaning that you will be paying extra.\r\n\r\nAlso note that a number of different things are not included in your Medicare. For instance, if you need a medical alert system, then this won’t be covered whereas some forms of insurance will include these types of costs. The same is true for things like certain dental procedures. For instance, some Medicare Advantage plans might include routine dental services, but this will rarely extend to such things as dental implants.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it can be a good idea for those that are receiving Medicare to also consider additional insurance on the side. This can then ensure that you are covered for all eventualities, and if the insurance is on top of Medicare, then it should be cheaper. Some premium insurers will actually include Medicare Advantage Programs as part of their service.\r\n\r\nLikewise, you may wish to get dental insurance on top of Medicare, even if you don’t take out a separate health insurance plan.\r\n\r\n## Signing Up\r\n\r\nIf you are enrolled in Social Security, then you will automatically be enrolled into Medicare when you turn 65. This means that you don’t need to change anything, and you can simply rest assured knowing that the basics of your medical care will be covered by the state. However, if you aren’t currently receiving Social Security, then you need to make sure you manually sign up before you turn 65. If you do not, then you may be required to pay more for the same services. Part B services will increase in cost by 10% each year if you fail to sign up, so it’s important to act quickly.\r\n\r\nYou can also sign up prior to turning 65 – up to 3 months before. This can be a good way to ensure that everything is in place ready, and it’s a good idea to do this as soon as possible. You’ll find that you are less likely to experience a gap in your insurance this way too, when you transfer from your current insurer to Medicare.\r\n\r\n## Medicaid\r\n\r\nMedicaid is a service that provides health coverage to millions of Americans, including low-income adults, elderly adults, children, and more. The program is run by states (based on federal requirements) and funded by a combination of the state and federal government.\r\n\r\nSome people find they get confused between these two programs, as they are each concerned with paying for medical services and expenses. The key difference is that Medicaid is a public assistance healthcare program for those on low incomes regardless of age, whereas Medicare is an age-based federal program.\r\n\r\nMedicaid covers different services depending on your state laws. Often included are outpatient hospital services, nursing home care, laboratory and x-ray diagnostics, transportation to medical facilities, tobacco counselling for pregnant women, and more.\r\n\r\n**Why Might You Need Both?**\r\n\r\nWhen comparing plans and options, it’s useful to look carefully into what is covered and what is not. One key difference between Medicare and Medicaid for the elderly, is that Medicare does not provide nursing home care, whereas Medicaid does. Medicare pays for skilled nursing and short-term rehabilitation, but not for ongoing care in a home<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nThis is an important consideration, and makes options such as FIDA plans more appropriate.\r\n\r\n## FIDA Plan\r\n\r\nA FIDA healthcare plan is a managed healthcare plan that combines the separate benefits of Medicare and Medicaid into a single plan<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nThis plan ensures that your medical and home care services work around your specific requirements so that you can live comfortable in your home the way you see fit. This is a flexible plan that is very much client-centric.\r\n\r\nThe plan has multiple benefits. For instance:\r\n\r\n- You and your care team – including the doctor – manage _all_ of your healthcare and home care keeping things easy and straightforward\r\n- You can keep your existing doctor\r\n- You don’t pay any monthly premiums, co-pays or other costs\r\n\r\n## What You Get\r\n\r\nThe following services are all covered at no additional cost if you use in-network providers and out of network providers:\r\n\r\n- Care from your physician\r\n- Transportation for visits\r\n- Immunization\r\n- Lab tests\r\n- Scans\r\n- Over-the-counter/brand name drugs\r\n- Occupational therapy\r\n- Speech therapy\r\n- Physical therapy\r\n- Rehabilitation\r\n- Urgent care and attention\r\n- Skilled nursing\r\n- Ambulance services\r\n- Hearing exams\r\n- Eye exams\r\n- Glasses\r\n- Contact lenses\r\n- Dental checkups\r\n- Hearing aids\r\n- Supplies and services for diabetes\r\n- Mental health services\r\n- Substance abuse help\r\n- Inpatient mental health\r\n- Housekeeping services\r\n- Healthcare services\r\n- Adult daycare\r\n- Meal delivery\r\n- Respite care for caregivers in the family\r\n- Nursing facilities\r\n- Assisted living services\r\n\r\nIf you choose to use an out of network provider then the provider must be eligible for Medicare participation. If you choose an ineligible provider then you will have to pay their costs, otherwise they will be covered by the plan.\r\n\r\nThis is not a comprehensive list and there are a wide range of additional services and benefits available.\r\n\r\n## Medigap\r\n\r\nAnother option is Medigap. Medigap is essentially a premium policy from a health insurance company that is designed specifically to fill the gaps not covered by Medicare<sup>5</sup>. We already discussed the benefit of using insurance companies on top of Medicare, but by using a Medigap policy, the terms will be designed specifically to complement one another, resulting in a comprehensive protection.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of options for seniors looking to ensure they are looked after financially and medically as they get older. This post has hopefully served as an introduction to some of those options. But most important is to carefully read the fine-print on all policies before you sign anything!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nOnline degrees offer a fantastic opportunity for seniors to expand their knowledge and to make themselves significantly more employable all from the comfort of their home. Traditional colleges are expensive, get students into debt and take many years to graduate. Thankfully these 2021 online degrees available from prestigious universities won’t break your bank. Don’t wait – get a pen and paper and begin researching all your online degree options now!\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1080x1080_onlinedegree_girlredshirt_compstudying.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1080x1080_onlinedegree_business_charts_stock.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1080x1080_onlinedegree_psyc_brain.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1080x1080_onlinedegree_computercode_screen.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1080x1080_onlinedegree_education_teacherwithstudents.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1080x1080_onlinedegree_nurse.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1200x628_ondeg_grandpaandkids.jpg)\r\n\r\nGetting a graduate or postgraduate degree is one of the very best ways to improve your employability, to increase your salary, and potentially to enhance your career and lifestyle. Degrees represent a level of excellence and mastery in a subject that other qualifications can’t match.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that degrees are extremely expensive and typically take multiple years to complete. This is why they are typically the remit of young kids in their late teens and early twenties. This type of student has the free time and low-responsibility to be able to dedicate that kind of time, and take on large amounts of debt. Those of us with families, children, and mortgages just don’t fall into the same camp.\r\n\r\nExcept that isn’t necessarily true anymore. Today, anyone can take a degree and they can do it from anywhere in the world. It’s possible now to take an MBA from the comfort of your home<sup>1</sup>! For those not familiar with the term, an MBA is one of the very most sought after business qualifications in the world – and can help you to walk into a high-paying managerial role at many organizations.\r\n\r\nThis is a strategy that is now appealing to more and more people, and it is completely transforming the jobs market. In this post, we’ll explore the trend in a little more detail.\r\n\r\n## Why Get An Online Degree?\r\n\r\nOnline degrees typically provide a number of impressive advantages over their in-person counterparts.\r\n\r\nWith an online degree, you’ll be able to:\r\n\r\n- Study during times that suite you – fitting around other responsibilities and commitments\r\n- Study from home, from the comfort of your bed even!\r\n- Choose from a near-limitless range of subjects – not limited by geographic constraints.\r\n- Save money on student accommodation or commuting.\r\n- Save money due to the lower cost incurred by the organization.\r\n- Still enjoy the ongoing support provided by a recognized learning institute.\r\n- Enhance your CV, increase your salary, switch careers!\r\n\r\nThis suddenly means that it’s feasible to become a student at any age. Many more senior citizens even are pursuing degrees and qualifications – either because they want to start a new career or business, or simply for the love of learning!\r\n\r\nMoreover, this provides the opportunity for young professionals who are already employed.\r\n\r\nThe days when a person would commit themselves to a single employer for their entire lives are over. These days, we change our jobs on average every 4.3 years<sup>2</sup>. Sometimes this means changing to a different employer while remaining in the same industry. On other occasions, it can mean a complete career change!\r\n\r\n## Why Now Is The Time To Do It\r\n\r\nWhat forces are forcing these trends? Why is now the time to invest in yourself and pursue further education?\r\n\r\nOne simple factor is that raises currently hover at around 3%. This provides ample incentive for employees to jump ship.\r\n\r\nAnother is the change in culture. Whereas it was once seen as noble to work the same job for 40 years, it is now considered a more fulfilling strategy to pursue your dream and perhaps see the world at the same time. The Instagram generation is less concerned with wages and more concerned with changing the world, helping people, or doing something creatively rewarding. Millennials therefore have a reputation for being “flaky” and struggling to hold down work.\r\n\r\nThe other thing to recognize, is that it’s now easier than ever before to find alternative jobs. The web makes it possible to work for a business on the other side of the world, or even to contract for businesses for weeks at a time. This is the “gig economy,” and it’s going to slowly erode the very notion of being “employed.”\r\n\r\nFor employers, it makes a lot of sense to hire a contractor from India to build a website in a week, rather than training a member of their own staff – especially when those members of staff might leave before the project is complete anyway.\r\n\r\nThis in turn means that employees are no longer progressing as quickly or developing themselves as much by remaining in the same job. Thus, if you want to start demanding big money, if you want to become a superstar in your industry… you need to take it upon _yourself_ to develop your CV and your skill set. That’s how you set yourself apart, and that’s how you prepare yourself for the huge changes that are coming our way.\r\n\r\n## Types Of Online Degrees\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different types of online degree you can take. These vary in price, in duration, and in the range of different subjects you can pursue<sup>3</sup>. For example:\r\n\r\n**Associate’s Degree**: This is a two-year degree that consists of roughly 60 credit hours. It’s a great starting point for beginning a new career, and is also half-way toward a bachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\n**Bachelor’s Degree**: A four year degree (or two if you have an Associate’s Degree already) that predictably requires 120 credit hours. This provides a flexible form of learning that allows students to continue working full time, while still getting a complete undergraduate degree upon completion.\r\n\r\n**Master’s Degree**: A master’s degree is a postgraduate degree that you can only complete following a bachelor’s. This is designed to improve your opportunities for advancement in a field of your choice. The programs are particularly appealing to those already working in a given field.\r\n\r\n**Doctorate**: Believe it or not, it is possible to get an online doctorate in 2020! This is the highest degree available in most fields, and thus will open up a huge amount of opportunities. You will also gain an unparalleled level of authority regarding your chosen subject matter, which can be a huge benefit in nearly any line of work, even if you are self-employed.\r\n\r\nUsually, you will pursue an online doctorate degree while continuing to work in the chosen field.\r\n\r\n## Take Your Next Steps Today\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many other types of qualification and certification that the conscientious student can pursue, and even a diploma or certification can make a big difference when rounding out a CV. Look at your current experience and the opportunities that have come up in the past, and ask what would help make you even more appealing for employers. Finally, think about how a qualification can improve your reputation and your status – even if you are self-employed, this can be a huge asset trying to find clients!\r\n\r\nReady to start building your CV and furthering your education? Begin your search to find a huge range of amazing deals on qualifications!\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nThanks to the internet, it’s now possible for anyone to become qualified in practically anything. This gives those willing to take the initiative the opportunity to make themselves significantly more competitive and employable. Why wait for your employer to send you on a training course, when you can study from the comfort of your own home? With an online business degree, you’ll be able to stand out in nearly any industry.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Cv-business-1024x680.jpg)A business degree will teach you the fundamental basics of business. That means you’ll be able to perform better in any role, in any industry. You’ll understand why people buy products, you’ll know how to motivate your team, and you’ll be familiar with concepts like MVP, BOM, USP, and breakeven.\r\n\r\nIn a time when employees will rarely stick with one employer for their entire careers, it’s increasingly unprofitable for organizations to pay for additional training for their staff. Thus, careers remain stifled and stagnant. By taking initiative and gaining online training, you can demonstrate your commitment, while also opening yourself up to other opportunities and higher-paid positions.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you need to know about getting a qualification online?\r\n\r\n## How to Get an MBA Online\r\n\r\nAn MBA is a Master of Business Administration, and is generally considered to be one of the most prestigious and sought-after business qualifications. Studying an MBA online is both expensive and time-consuming, but graduates will be able to walk into many more positions once they have completed their study, as well as commanding much higher salaries.\r\n\r\nIf you are studying an MBA online, then you will have two primary options available to you:\r\n\r\n- Executive MBA\r\n- Part-Time MBA\r\n\r\nThe Part Time MBA is aimed primarily at students between 24-35 years old, who are not yet in leadership positions. The Executive MBA is aimed specifically at managers and above, aged 34-42<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nEither way, the MBA will cover a range of topics relating to business, including (but not limited to):\r\n\r\n- Corporate finance\r\n- Operations management\r\n- Legal\r\n- Economics\r\n- Financial accounting\r\n- Global strategy\r\n- Professional writing\r\n- Leadership\r\n- Marketing\r\n- Business ethics\r\n- Global strategy\r\n\r\n### Online MBA Courses to Consider\r\n\r\nIf you decide to go ahead with an online MBA course, here are some options to consider.\r\n\r\n- MBA Degree: Master’s in Business Administration from Boston University<sup>2</sup>\r\n- MBA – Warrington College of Business<sup>3</sup>\r\n- Executive MBA from University of Virginia<sup>4</sup>\r\n\r\nIt’s worth investigating precisely which topics will be covered by a given degree. Compare this to the skills listed on job listings that you might potentially be interested in applying to.\r\n\r\nYou should also check pricing, as well as what distance learning entails. How long do you have to complete the course? How many hours will you be expected to work each week? Assess whether you can fit this online business degree around your lifestyle before making a commitment.\r\n\r\n### Bachelor’s Degrees in Business Administration\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, an MBA is a huge commitment for anyone looking to gain an additional online business degree. Therefore, many readers will be better served by smaller degrees and qualifications.\r\n\r\nThere are a huge range of different online business degrees available, which include specialist topics as well as more general introductions.\r\n\r\nWhen selecting from any of these, you should look for accreditation. Organizations such as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSOC)<sup>5</sup> and The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB)<sup>6</sup> offer accreditation to offer some peace of mind.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of great online undergraduate programs for those looking for business qualifications. For example, The Bachelor of Science in Business Management from Key West University, Jacksonville, offers a full-time 4-year online degree that can be completed remotely<sup>7</sup>.\r\n\r\nThe Bachelor in Business Management (Online) from Schellhammer Business School in Spain offers a fast-tracked 240-credit course that will take an online student 3 years to complete<sup>8</sup>.\r\n\r\nFor those looking to invest less time, the BA (Hons) in Business Management from London School of Planning and Management can be completed in 18 months of part-time study<sup>9</sup>. Find the course that best suits your availability, timeframe, and budget. Make sure to also consider the precise modules, and the types of work you are hoping to find after completing the degree when making your choice.\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, business qualifications have become so in-demand that even some of these are now quite competitive to get onto. The good news, is that you can improve your chances of success with further online training. For example, taking the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT)<sup>10</sup> can actually help you to improve your chances of getting onto the top online business courses. This will give you a score out of 800, where anything above 730 will improve your odds.\r\n\r\nFor those that don’t have the time to complete a BA or a BSc, another option is to look into shorter courses. If you are already in the workplace and you’re looking for an online qualification that you can obtain while working your regular job, then finding something smaller and more specific may be a better strategy.\r\n\r\nFor example, a visit to a site like edx.org<sup>11 </sup>will help you to find many shorter courses in specific subjects such as business writing, or business fundamentals. The Business Writing from Berkeley University of California for instance is a $267.30 course that will teach you better communication and help you write more effective emails, letters, and reports. This can perfectly supplement a CV, without requiring a huge time commitment from you: there are three courses lasting four weeks each, and requiring a total commitment of 3-5 hours each week.\r\n\r\nThis is really the biggest benefit of online learning: you can find any kind of qualification to suit your lifestyle and your goals. Mix and match to build your perfect CV, and leave your peers behind!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nA portable oxygen generator is a device that can be used to provide oxygen therapy. This can help those that are struggling with their breathing, by offering oxygen in greater concentrations than those available from the ambient air.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful for those with asthma, chest infections, and a host of other breathing conditions. If you don’t know when you are going to suffer breathing difficulties, then having a portable oxygen generator (also called a portable oxygen concentrator) may be the difference between life and death.\r\n\r\nThat of course means that you don’t want to cut corners and end up investing in a sub-par product. But seeing as these are expensive and heavy devices, you also need to think carefully about what you can do to get the best deal possible.\r\n\r\nRead on and we’ll take a look at some of the best tips for choosing a portable oxygen generator that will do a great job without breaking the bank.\r\n\r\n## How Do Oxygen Generators Work?\r\n\r\nWhen you inhale oxygen from the air around you, you’re actually inhaling 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen (the rest is “other gases). This means that the body has to work hard in order to get the oxygen it needs and to extract it from the environment.\r\n\r\nConversely, an oxygen generator provides air that is made of over 95% oxygen for the user to breathe. This is possible because the device is able to absorb oxygen through an inlet filter, in order to compress it and store it in containers. Meanwhile, excess nitrogen is removed and the oxygen is provided to the patient via a tube and a mask.\r\n\r\n## Choosing the Right Concentrators\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that you need to consider when choosing an oxygen concentrator. The first is just how portable it really is. The smaller units of course will be able to deliver less oxygen per minute (this is measured in LPM), but will be more portable for carrying around. If you suffer with asthma or another condition that could affect you at any time, then being able to carry the oxygen concentrator with you might be a requirement. Does this fit into a backpack?\r\n\r\nConversely, if you are struggling with sleep apnea, then you may be using the concentrator with a CAPD (Continuous Airway Pressure Device), to prevent your airways from closing over. In this situation, you won’t need the device unless you are sleeping, meaning you are only likely to need to bring it to hotels and camping sites. With that in mind, you can invest in a larger item.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is battery life. Again, if the unit is going to be carried around with you, then you need something that has a long battery life so that it won’t run out just when you need it most.\r\n\r\n## Money Saving Tips\r\n\r\nGenerally, there is a big difference between a pressurized oxygen cylinder and a portable oxygen concentrator. The former is a much larger device, weighing up to 114 lbs., while the latter is truly portable and often only weighs 20 lbs. None of these devices is “light” as such though, which is important to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nPressurized oxygen cylinders also don’t provide a permanent supply of oxygen, rather they simply contain a certain amount of oxygen that you can use in an emergency. Your job will be to refill these regularly, which usually means visiting a supplier.\r\n\r\nThat said, an oxygen cylinder also costs much less. Again then, if you’re in a situation where you don’t need the oxygen regularly, you might consider this as an option.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, when choosing your portable oxygen generator, you should be sure to look into financing options. You might find that you can get grants, tax breaks, or other financial help from the government or even charities. You should also check to see if an oxygen concentrator is covered by your insurance. After all, this is not a luxury item, but rather something that you need in order to look after your health.\r\n\r\nFinally, consider looking at refurbished and second hand generators. While you might not like the thought of using a second hand generator, if this is the best way you can afford one, it is certainly better than going without. Refurbished means that the generator has been thoroughly checked and repaired where necessary, ensuring that it essentially operates “as new.” This can offer a big saving, without impacting performance in any way.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nA prepaid legal service is essentially like a form of legal insurance. In fact, the product is even sometimes referred to as personal legal insurance! This basically involves paying up-front, in order to gain protection later. As we will see in the course of this article, that can save you a lot of money directly, and indirectly.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Prepaid-legal-1024x595.jpg)Here’s what you need to know.\r\n\r\n## How Prepaid Legal Services Save You Money\r\n\r\nThe issue is that legal expenses can be costly, but they can also be unavoidable. Let’s say that someone rear-ends you and refuses to pay up. Or what if you’re accused of a crime and forced to defend yourself in court? Maybe your business is being taken to court for negligence.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, you are now forced to either pay a hefty fine, or shell out huge amounts of money for legal fees. If you should lose your case, you’ll now have to pay those fees **and** the costs associated with the legal aid!\r\n\r\nThis leaves the average person in a sticky situation. The law should theoretically be there to protect the average citizen: to ensure that they have the same defense and fair treatment as everyone else. But because there is a cost on legal support, this means that people who are better funded can take advantage of those who aren’t.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s wrong.\r\n\r\nPrepaid legal services can help to solve this problem. By paying in advance, you’ll essentially have access to legal services when you need them (within reason). This not only means that you’ll never find yourself taking out huge loans just to afford legal expenses that you need, but it also means you’ll be able to confidently stand up for yourself, knowing that you will have that support if you need it. It means that no one can strong-arm you into out-of-court settlements, or paying for things that you\r\n\r\nThis can save you thousands of dollars by not _only_ helping you to win cases, but also giving you the confidence to take people on legally when you have a right to.\r\n\r\n## How it Works – The Details\r\n\r\nSo how does this work?\r\n\r\nWhat’s important to remember, is that personal legal insurance is not really insurance. Think of it more as a discount plan, which means that you’re not going to get full legal fees entirely for free!\r\n\r\nWhat will normally be covered by this kind of plan is the consultation you would normally have with a lawyer at their hourly rate. This can normally cost hundreds of dollars, so that’s already a big saving!\r\n\r\nLikewise, the costs associated with preparing or reviewing documents will also be covered, such as advance healthcare directives. In some cases, you may even get unlimited access to attorneys through toll-free numbers!\r\n\r\nBut there will likewise be many services not covered. For example, you will normally only be able to choose from a limited number of providers. In some cases, those prepaid legal services will have been purchased directly from a law firm – tying you to that provider only.\r\n\r\nSome services will be discounted but not fully covered. These might include such things as filing fees, or expert witness fees.\r\n\r\nSome services will be completely omitted. These often include such things as court appearances, business advice, or employment issues. Likewise, you won’t be able to use this insurance to simply start suing people! If you attempt to file a lawsuit that could be considered frivolous, you likely won’t get any financial aid<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n## Making the Right Choice for You\r\n\r\nOf course, the specifics on offer will vary depending on the company providing your prepaid legal services, and on the package. More comprehensive plans tend to cost more, but they might also **save** you a lot more in future. As with all types of insurance, it’s not about whether you can afford to have it, but whether you can afford **not to**.\r\n\r\nDo keep in mind that in some cases, you will have certain legal fees already covered by other types of insurance. For instance, your auto insurance may actually cover that aforementioned rear-ending scenario.\r\n\r\nBut remember: prepaid legal services don’t only save you money by helping you to win cases and defend yourself. They **also** save you money by giving you confidence and advice, and helping you to navigate a world that has become very sue-happy. With prepaid legal services, you have the law on your side, and a lawyer in your corner. So lawyer up!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nSmoking is an extremely destructive habit that has a plethora of negative effects on your health and your lifestyle. These range from the obvious (lung problems, financial strain, addiction), to the less readily apparent (poor sleep, strained relationships, headaches). Whether you want to have more energy, look more attractive, become more athletic, or increase your personal wealth, quitting smoking should be a _top_ priority.\r\n\r\nBut of course, you knew that already. The issue is that you don’t know how to go about making it happen.\r\n\r\nHow can you kick smoking to the curb when it’s both psychologically and physically addictive? How can you succeed where so many others have failed? What strategies and tricks can help you to take back your control and destroy this ugly habit?\r\n\r\n## Over-exposure\r\n\r\nThere are countless strategies that you have no doubt already tried. These probably include such options as nicotine patches, switching to vapes, and going cold-turkey. But as you’re reading this post, it’s probably fair to assume they didn’t work for you.\r\n\r\nSomething more drastic is in order then, and a great one to start with is over-exposure. This essentially means you’re going to smoke 10, 20, or 25 cigarettes in a row (back to back). Choose a number that is absolutely abhorrent to you and then force yourself to go through it.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a horrible and disgusting experience but that is _the entire point_. By the time you’ve gotten through so many cigarettes, you’ll find that you can’t stand the _thought_ of having even one more!\r\n\r\nOf course, this feeling will wear off over time, but it will leave a strong memory of all the most _unpleasant_ effects of smoking. Next time you want to convince yourself _not_ to have that cigarette before bed, you can simply call on the memories of how sick you felt and how dry your mouth was!\r\n\r\n## CBT\r\n\r\nThat latter strategy is very similar to a larger approach known as CBT. This is “cognitive behavioral therapy,” which is a psychotherapeutic approach to mental health that focusses on the way our thoughts dictate our emotions and our actions.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you are someone who smokes, then there’s a high chance that you will make lots of excuses to yourself in your mind. It’s like a little devil sitting on your shoulder, and it’s certainly not helpful!\r\n\r\nThe aim of CBT in this context is to help you _change_ that voice. This means you first need to identify precisely what it’s saying and when it’s cropping up, and then you need to convince yourself that it is _wrong_ and find ways to make it quieter<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nUsually, this involves the use of two strategies:\r\n\r\n- Hypothesis testing\r\n- Thought challenging\r\n\r\nThought challenging means you’re going to logically break down the argument to find out if there is any truth to it. For example: you might tell yourself that you “deserve” to have a cigarette because you’ve had a hard day. During thought challenging, you might ask whether this is really a suitable reward. Likewise, you might point out that there will be many hard days like this – meaning that if you have a cigarette now, you are essentially admitting defeat and committing to having _many_ more in the future.\r\n\r\nFocus on what’s bad about cigarettes and what’s good about quitting, and then don’t allow for illogical arguments you might try to make to continue smoking.\r\n\r\n## Find Your Why\r\n\r\nYour “why” is essentially your reason for wanting to quit. This is what motivated you to read this article in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis should be your emotional drive, the thing that connects to your values<sup>2</sup>, and the thing that you are most excited. Try to visualize an emotional scene, whether that’s feeling proud as a healthy non-smoker while playing with your kids, or whether it’s being able to go for a long run without coughing and spluttering!\r\n\r\nThe more tangible and resonate this idea, the more motivated you’ll be when the going gets tough!\r\n\r\n## Create a Streak\r\n\r\nAlso called the “Seinfeld Strategy,” the aim here is to simply take a small step every single day toward your goal. While the “why” should provide the emotional heft that motivates you, this should not be your focus. Your goal isn’t to stop smoking.\r\n\r\nSo, what is your goal?\r\n\r\nIt’s to smoke no (0) cigarettes, every single day. What’s the difference? The latter goal is more effective because it’s something you can immediately pass or fail, it’s something completely within your control, and it’s something that you can try again tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis removes many of the potential arguments we can use to smoke. There’s no “I’ll make up for it tomorrow.” There’s no: “I’ve already failed at my goal.” The goal starts fresh every day. You either succeed or you don’t.\r\n\r\nThis is called the Seinfeld strategy, because Jerry Seinfeld described using this strategy in conjunction with a calendar. On that calendar, he would put a tick next to every day he did the “thing” he was trying to achieve. This would create a streak (a line of ticks) and he’d find that the compulsion to _maintain_ that streak was incredibly strong. In other words: you won’t want to stop smoking because it will mean a gap in your calendar!<sup>3</sup>\r\n\r\n## Change Your Environment and Routines\r\n\r\nThe brain is made up of billions of neurons, with many more billions of connections between them. This is why it is sometimes referred to as a “connectome.”\r\n\r\nWhat that means, is that whenever one thing happens in the brain, it will trigger an action elsewhere in the brain. This is why we can only sing the alphabet in order, and it’s why one thought will often prompt a related one.\r\n\r\nBut what you might not realize is just how much this can also be a bad thing: when one habit or stimulus triggers us to do something we don’t want to. This is why so many people smoke when they drink, or at a set time in the morning for instance.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to look for triggers in your routine and eliminate them. But what’s more, is that you should consider changing your environment – at least for a while. Avoid situations where you would normally smoke, and try to change as much about your current routine and surrounds as you can in one go.\r\n\r\n## Find Other Habits\r\n\r\nFinally, keep in mind that it’s hard to give up one lifetime habit without starting something new. Find a new habit that can replace the old one, and use this whenever you get the itch to smoke. Ideally, make this something that you really look forward to and that will be motivating in itself.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nWith a degree in criminal justice, you’ll be prepared for a number of exciting, well-paid roles, that genuinely help people. This is a highly rewarding job, and one that will always be in demand.\r\n\r\nDon’t know what a criminal justice degree can do for you? Essentially, this is the degree you will take if you are interested in advancing a career in law enforcement. For those finishing school, this is a great choice for entering the force at a higher level, and receiving better pay and more interesting work as a result. For those already working as police officers or in related roles, this can be a great option for career advancement.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/crim-justice.jpg)And because it’s not possible to get a criminal justice degree online, that means it’s more than possible to “learn while you earn.”\r\n\r\nBut just how much of a commitment will you be making? How intensive is this degree? And can it really make a big difference to your salary and prospects?\r\n\r\n## What You Will Learn\r\n\r\nIf you take a criminal justice degree, you will learn some more in-depth aspects of law enforcement and detective work. These include<sup>1</sup>:\r\n\r\n**Chain of Evidence**\r\n\r\nThis is a key subject matter that is critical to understand law enforcement. This looks at the procedures necessary to keep evidence clean and to avoid tainting or tampering. Students learn the basics and how to handle different types of evidence.\r\n\r\n**Law and Due Process**\r\n\r\nDue process refers to the way the law is enforced. It discusses the court systems, and how to secure a crime scene/interview suspects, make an arrest, etc.\r\n\r\n**Use of Proper Force**\r\n\r\nThis teaches students how to use appropriate force for any given situation in order to maximize their own safety, and that of the suspect.\r\n\r\n**Media Relations**\r\n\r\nA surprisingly large amount of police work involves communicating with press. This module teaches how to handle that relationship in order to improve outcomes and to improve public relations.\r\n\r\n**Investigative Principles**\r\n\r\nOne of the largest subject matters. This involves talking to witnesses, finding and interviewing suspects, collecting evidence, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you think these subject matters sound interesting, then you may enjoy a criminal justice degree.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is possible to enter the force without a degree. A police officer can begin their career with no more than a high school diploma. However, with a bachelor’s in criminal justice, a candidate will be able to enter at a higher level, or progress more quickly.\r\n\r\n### Online Degrees\r\n\r\nAs many aspects of criminal justice are inherently physical, you may be concerned that completing a degree online will leave you with a lesser understanding. Indeed, this was once the view among employers, but that view has since evolved. Students find that their online degrees are treated as equal to any others, and that they have just as complete an understanding.\r\n\r\nNot only is all the theory the precise same, but students are given the opportunity to learn in person by completing externships and similar opportunities. And indeed, candidates do not even need to reveal on their application that their degree was earned online. It is generally thought that employers are more concerned with the name of the school, which has a bigger bearing on the quality of the education.\r\n\r\nAnd remember: it is possible to get a job on the force with a diploma. Any form of bachelor’s degree will be a significant step up from that, and a lot of practical learning will happen “on the job.”\r\n\r\n**Criminology vs Criminal Justice**\r\n\r\nCriminology and criminal justice are distinct disciplines. Criminology is the specific study of crime, and this can lead to positions in welfare and social work. Criminal justice on the other hand is specifically focused on the criminal system, due process, and the knowledge necessary to work in law enforcement.\r\n\r\n## Career Prospects\r\n\r\nWith a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice, you will be eligible to apply to a wide range of positions within the police force. Some common job roles for graduates include:\r\n\r\n- Probation officer\r\n- Forensic science technician\r\n- Private detective\r\n- Security guard\r\n- Crime scene investigator\r\n- Computer forensics investigator\r\n- State trooper\r\n- Correctional officer\r\n\r\nAnd more<sup>3</sup>!\r\n\r\nIt’s worth noting that any bachelor’s degree can prepare you for a host of different job roles. Earning a bachelor’s will demonstrate a great deal of commitment, motivation, critical thinking, communication, and more. This can help you to enter nearly any organization at a higher level than you otherwise would. So even if you don’t have a specific job role in mind, if you find police work fascinating as many people do… you might consider an online criminal justice degree!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nStair lifts can become a necessity for many people once they reach a certain age. These are of course platforms that can carry an individual up and down a flight of stairs, thereby allowing them to change floor with the use of a wheelchair, or without needing to place a lot of extra weight on their knees.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/walking-up-stairsjpg-1024x763.jpg)There are many considerations to take into account when choosing a stair lift. For example, you need to ensure that the stair lift is going to provide easy access for you, as well as for anyone else who may **not** require the lift in order to get up and down. Likewise, you need to consider the amount of time it takes to travel from the top of the stairs to the bottom (and vice versa), as well as whether the same stair lift is likely to be suitable for you in 10 years’ time.\r\n\r\n## Some Important Points About Stair Lifts\r\n\r\nThe first thing to consider is the type of stair lift you plan on buying. For example, do you invest in a standing or sitting stair lift? Do you need a stair lift that can carry a wheelchair as well?\r\n\r\nA standing stair lift will essentially allow you to step onto a platform and will then carry you up the stairs. As long as you are comfortable standing for this duration, this can actually be the easier option as you don’t need to get into a deep seat. A compromise solution is something called a “perch stair lift,” which will effectively have you in a half-standing, and half seated position. In all case, there should be a seatbelt or other harness to keep you strapped in.\r\n\r\nThis is where it can be important to think about your situation in 5 years’ time. While you might be happy with a standing stair lift right now, it’s possible it would be more sensible to install a seated stair lift to ensure you can use it for a long time.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is whether the stair lift is going to go in a straight line, or whether it is going to go around corners. This will of course depend on the nature of your home. Another type of stair lift is the outdoor lift, which will lead up to your home.\r\n\r\n### Some Questions to Ask\r\n\r\nYou need to ask yourself whether you really need a stair lift before you part with your hard-earned cash. If climbing the stairs has become a daily challenge, then you might be inclined to think that a stair lift will offer the right solution. Keep in mind though, that once you stop climbing the stairs daily, you may quickly lose the ability to do so at all.\r\n\r\nFitting a stair lift can be completed in 24 hours in many cases. This means that you don’t necessarily need to invest in a stair lift now in case of future issues. Rather, you can get the stair lift installed as soon as you need it.\r\n\r\nYou may want to ask a few final questions about the stair lift in question as well, before finalizing your purchase. For example, how much noise does it make? This can be important if you often need to go downstairs during the night and you don’t want to risk waking your other half.\r\n\r\n### How to Get Your Stair Lift for Less\r\n\r\nA stair lift can be an expensive purchase, but fortunately there are a number of ways to cut back the costs and get the installation for less.\r\n\r\nOne is to consider a refurbished stair lift<sup>1</sup>. This is a stair lift that has had a previous owner, but which has been thoroughly checked for healthy operation, and had any parts repaired or fixed as necessary. While you might feel uncertain about buying a used item like this, the truth is that most refurbished stair lifts are every bit as reliable and functional as their brand new counterparts. That means you can make a significant saving while still getting the exact same performance – this comes as a recommended strategy.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to look into tax exemption, grants from governments or charities, and insurance policies. This is an installation that you have been forced to make, owing to your current physical condition. You need to be able to move freely around your home in order to continue looking after yourself – especially if the bathroom is up there! In other words, this is not a luxury but a requirement, and as such, you shouldn’t need to pay full price for it.\r\n\r\nFinally, make sure that you check the cost of installation when purchasing. This may not be included in the price, and that can of course impact on the most cost effective solution for you.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nDental implants are permanent fixtures that a dentist will attach to your gums and jawbone in order to replace missing or damaged teeth. This can provide a permanent solution to many dental health issues for senior patients, making it a popular procedure despite the invasive nature and cost. In short, dental implants can make you feel much younger and improve your life in countless ways.\r\n\r\n## ![](/posts/dental-implants-1024x768.jpg)What Are Dental Implants?\r\n\r\nDental implants involve drilling into the gums and jaws in order to create pegs. These pegs then allow new false teeth to be screwed into place, where they will remain permanently. As the patient, you will be able to choose precisely how you want your new smile to look, and that will extend to selecting the color of your implants.\r\n\r\nThe cost of dental implants can vary significantly though, and this is something to consider when discussing options with your dentist. Not only that, but the procedure itself can vary significantly depending on the nature of the issue you are trying to address.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, dental implants will not be used on their own, but rather in conjunction with other procedures. For instance, if you have teeth missing, then you might use a combination of dental implants and bridges in order to solve the problem. This can help to control the cost, as well as the invasiveness of the procedure. If you use bridges for instance, then you will need _fewer_ dental implants.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the type of dental implant varies. For instance, some implants are made from zirconium, while others are made from titanium.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the cost of a single dental implant can range from $500 to $6,000! This includes the abutment (the peg) as well as the cost, along with the procedure itself and after care<sup>1</sup>. This price can vary a lot then, but keep in mind that you will usually visit the dentist multiple times throughout the process.\r\n\r\nFor a full mouth of new implants, you can end up paying anything from $30,000 to $90,000!\r\n\r\n## How Dental Implants Are Used in Conjunction With Other Techniques to Solve Various Problems\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the huge range of prices and the different types of procedure, it can be useful to consider how a dentist might help you to approach various different problems with your teeth. Here are some examples that show how dental implants can be used in conjunction with different methods.\r\n\r\n**You Have Missing Teeth:** If you have one or lots of missing teeth then you are probably experiencing one of the very most common complaints for people who aren’t happy with their smiles. A simple missing tooth can be very disconcerting and is far from being a desirable look. It also creates other issues, allowing other teeth to move and making it difficult to chew. Fortunately, there are _many_ different solutions to this problem.\r\n\r\nThe obvious option is the dental implant, which as we’ve seen can cost anything up to $6,000 including anesthesia, consultations, materials, and more.\r\n\r\nAnother is to get bridges. Bridges like dental implants provide you with an entirely new tooth in the place of the gap, but are different in that they are far less invasive. Rather than being screwed into the gums and jaws like dental implants, bridges are simply placed between two existing teeth. Of course, this means that you are requires to have the two teeth on either side for you to be able to support the bridge, and it also won’t be as secure as implants. However, they will still be permanent and will require no real discomfort on your part. Here it’s possible to have a combination of these two procedures – using bridges where you have some existing teeth to support the new ones and using dental implants in the rest of your mouth. As bridges are less expensive than implants (and less invasive), you may wish to have a few implants to use as anchors, with bridges placed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can even use the implants in order to support the bridges.\r\n\r\nFinally, if permanency is not a problem for you, then you could also look into getting removable dentures. Removable dentures are simply false teeth that you can take out or put in at will, but that which must be removed overnight. This of course requires no painful surgery and also means that you can have them altered easily as your mouth changes shape and you lose more teeth. Of course it has some problems regarding how you feel about the need for your teeth to be truly your own, and whether you want to look good all night long (it can be a turn off to bring someone home and then have to remove your teeth). Removable dentures also are more prone to getting lost or damaged and must be removed when consuming some foods and drinks.\r\n\r\nAgain, some people will opt for a combination of dentures and implants. This can provide more support for the mouth (avoiding the wrinkled look that a lack of teeth can create) and make chewing and eating easier – while also saving money. You can also use a combination of dentures and implants as a stopgap (no pun intended) while you wait for the next round of implants.\r\n\r\n**Your Teeth Are Crooked:** If your teeth are crooked then this could very often be a result of overcrowding or undercrowding. This means that you have too many teeth in your mouth and they are as such being pushed by each other into unfavorable positions. If you previously had perfectly straight teeth, then there is a good chance that your teeth were forced to become crooked when your wisdom teeth came through. The best thing to do in this scenario then is to get cosmetic dental surgery in order to remove the teeth that are causing the most difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons that your teeth may be crooked however. For example, it may in fact be that your teeth have too many gaps, and as such your teeth have nothing to support them and to cause them to grow in a straight line. This can particularly be a problem as the teeth are developing. Sometimes it will be possible to straighten crooked teeth then by placing new teeth in next to them to force them into alignment with dental implants for example, however this won’t always be possible or affective. This is where an implant can be useful once again.\r\n\r\nAnother solution to having crooked teeth is to get veneers. Veneers are essentially recreated fronts of your teeth which attach to your teeth on the side facing outwards using a permanent cement. Once these veneers are attached, they will remain in the mouth and will hide your real teeth while showing these new specially designed fronts. This can be used to change many elements of your teeth, not least including their straightness – as the veneers fit perfectly together so it will seem that your teeth fit perfectly together.\r\n\r\nAnother solution which many of us will think about early on is to get braces. Braces will essentially hold your teeth in position, and this will gradually force them to move until they are straighter. This is a lengthy process and has some impracticalities while you wait for it to work in that it prevents you from eating certain things and can make your smile look _worse_ while you wait to be able to take the braces out. However, it is also a very permanent way to realign your teeth that will not only avoid any painful and invasive procedure, but also avoid you having to have something in your mouth that isn’t genuinely a part of you. In this sense braces are a very ‘natural’ way to get your teeth straightened. For those who don’t want to have to put up with tracks and avoid certain foods however it is also possible to use other methods such as ‘Invisalign’ which is a plastic cover that holds your teeth in place. This is removable meaning you can take it out for posh occasions and when eating, but it’s also transparent meaning that it’s less noticeable when you’re wearing it. The downside of Invisalign when compared to braces is that it is slightly less efficient as the teeth have to fit into the round indentations of the cover rather than being held in place by tracks, and because the person wearing them can simply remove them. However, at the same time they also have their own advantages – for example allowing the wearer to ‘upgrade’ their Invisalign as the condition of their teeth improves. For example then, as the teeth become more aligned they can have a newly reshaped cover that is more fitting of their new position. This way it can more quickly improve the look of your teeth.\r\n\r\nFinally, another solution to the problem of crooked teeth is often to file them down. Here the teeth are re-sculpted in order to make them look straighter. This can also solve problems where one tooth blocks another causing plaque and sugar to get stuck where it can cause damage to the tooth behind.\r\n\r\nBy combining these techniques it’s also possible to make an even more impressively straight look for your teeth – for example by removing teeth and filing them down before using a combination of implants and veneers to cap the fronts. Alternatively, a dentist may recommend that you use Invisalign to straighten your teeth, while also inserting new implants once that process is over to _keep_ the teeth in their new positions.\r\n\r\nAs you can see then, the cost of dental implants is not simple to calculate and will vary greatly from case to case. Think about what you need, and be open to all options!\r\n\r\n1. [The Cost of Dental Implants Broken Down](https://www.spiritdental.com/blog/individuals/the-cost-of-dental-implants-broken-down)\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nIf you’re looking for a way to advance your career, then you may have considered taking an online MBA. An MBA (Master of Business Administration,) is widely considered to be the most sought-after qualifications in business. With this qualification under your belt, you will be able to walk into a large number of management roles, and will likely enjoy an increased salary at your current place of work. Thanks to the web, it’s possible to get this prestigious qualification from the comfort of your own home, working on a part-time basis!\r\n\r\n![](/posts/MBA-Degree-1024x681.jpg)But what exactly does an MBA entail? Just how much of a commitment are you making? And how do you get started? This post will tell you everything you need to get started with an online MBA, and whether it’s a smart option to supercharge your career.\r\n\r\n## What is an MBA? Is it Hard?\r\n\r\nIf you choose to take an MBA degree, you’ll essentially be learning the ins-and-outs of business, and how to build a business model that will be profitable and sustainable for the long-term. This can be useful for entrepreneurs, for managers, executives, and employees that want to learn how their business ticks.\r\n\r\nIn general, an MBA is a “big picture” degree, meaning that you’ll be learning broader concepts more so than specific strategies or facts.\r\n\r\nAn MBA teaches us that a business is all about systems: implementing processes that generate revenue. For example, if you can automate an aspect of your business, or implement a “force multiplier,” (a tool that helps the same team to complete more work, more quickly), then you can greatly increase output, turnover, and profit, without significantly increasing your overheads. Likewise, improving efficiency by reducing the time that staff spend waiting for computers to load up, or by streamlining communication, can all impact on your bottom line<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nAn MBA will also explain how to create value, and how to understand very human drives. Products and services sold to the consumer are typically sold based on emotion and not logic. Therefore, smart marketing can evoke an emotional response in the viewer, and ultimately move them to make a purchase. Likewise, an understanding of human nature can help you to be a better manager or leader, by understanding concepts like convergence and divergence<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nMBAs will teach branding, leadership, basic accounting, communication, and more. Ultimately, this will provide the graduate with a well-rounded understanding of business, as well as a hot of skills that they can use to improve their management style and business accounting.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, an MBA will likely cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n- <a><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">Corporate finance</span></a>\r\n- Operations management\r\n- Legal\r\n- Economics\r\n- Financial accounting\r\n- Global strategy\r\n- Professional writing\r\n- Leadership\r\n- Marketing\r\n- Business ethics\r\n- Global strategy\r\n\r\nIf you are systems minded, if you like learning about people, and if you are able to take a “big picture” view, then these are not hard concepts to grasp. There is a little terminology, but very little in the way of hard stats and figures that need to be memorized. As many of these lessons can be applied to other aspects of life, they are inherently interesting and usually easy to commit to memory.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started With an MBA\r\n\r\nThere are many options available for those interested in gaining an MBA online, making it possible for anyone to train and get qualified while also holding down a full-time job. The challenge is that an MBA is both expensive and time consuming. Fortunately, the flexibility of remote learning options and the sheer variety of courses on offer, ensures that you can find the best course to suit your lifestyle.\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of MBA you can take online. These are an Executive MBA and a Part-Time MBA\r\n\r\nThe **Part-Time MBA** is primarily intended for younger professionals (aged 24-35) not currently in management positions, but looking to accelerate their career and expand their horizons.\r\n\r\nThe **Executive MBA** on the other hand is aimed at older managers and executives aiming to improve their leadership style.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that you want to go either of these routes, then you should be able to find a number of online courses that provide what you’re looking for. Here are three examples of online MBA courses:\r\n\r\n- MBA Degree: Master’s in Business Administration from Boston University<sup>3</sup>\r\n- MBA – Warrington College of Business<sup>4</sup>\r\n- Executive MBA from University of Virginia<sup>5</sup>\r\n\r\n## Other Options\r\n\r\nIf you decide that an MBA is too expensive and involved for you, there are some alternative options. One such option is to do something called a MicroMasters. A MicroMasters will give you a much shorter introduction to the MBA program, while teaching specific skills that could be enough to give you an edge in business and set you apart from the competition.\r\n\r\nFor example, the MicroMasters Program in MBA Core Curriculum from the University System of Maryland<sup>6</sup> will teach the fundamentals of business, and provide a MicroMasters MBA qualification at the end. This is recognized by employers and will appeal to many businesses and managers.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the MicroMasters will serve as 25% of a full MBA degree. You can then choose to complete the rest of the qualification via the Robert H. Smith School of Business MBA Program. The program lasts for one year, and students are expected to commit 8-10 hours per week to their learning<sup>6</sup>.\r\n\r\nThere are many more courses like this one, so take a look around sites like EDX.org for a wide variety of MicroMasters and shorter courses.\r\n\r\nAs you can see then, there are many options for starting an MBA, any of which can help to give you an edge over the competition when it comes to business. You’ll be more employable, and you’ll have the skills you need to run your own successful business. And if doing an MBA online is too much of a commitment, there are plenty of other more flexible options!\r\n\r\n1. **[The Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman](https://personalmba.com/)**\r\n2.

      "content": "\r\nInvesting is the secret sauce that separates the extremely rich. It doesn’t make any difference how much you make. Your decision to either invest your money wisely or leave it in a regular account, is what will determine just how much it grows with time, and whether or not you can eventually consider yourself to be “wealthy.”\r\n\r\nExploring the world of alternative investments can be daunting, but fortunately there’s many alternative investment opportunities that can be taken advantage of if you’re not looking for your cash to sit in a savings account.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Think-outside-the-box.jpg)\r\n\r\nInvesting is something that everyone should consider once they start to build up a certain amount of cash in the bank. If you let it sit in an ISA or savings account, you’ll be making miniscule interest when you could be increasing its value by a lot more.\r\n\r\nBut then again, putting money into a savings account is likely to offer feeble returns right – especially with interest rates being so low. In many cases, savings accounts are able to offer little more than regular checking accounts, making the exercise almost pointless. If you have a regular amount of savings, then these accounts offer very little in return. And if you have enough money to make a saving’s account worthwhile, then you’d be wasting _thousands_ by not putting it somewhere more lucrative.\r\n\r\nThe other option of course is to create a proper investment portfolio of stocks and shares – spending thousands of dollars to back specific companies, or paying into a hedge fund that can do that for you. But investing in stocks and shares is a frightening prospect for many people who aren’t familiar with investing or trading, and owing to the current uncertainty in the market, it might not even be a wholly wise decision right now.\r\n\r\nSo, what other options do you have?\r\n\r\n## Why Invest in Gold and Other Physical Assets?\r\n\r\nOne of the best “alternative investments” is to invest in physical assets like gold…\r\n\r\nOf course, financial assets include things like stocks, shares or bonds, while physical assets are things like real-estate or gold bullion.\r\n\r\nIn times of economic hardship, financial assets will suffer as a result of unstable markets and volatile currencies. Some physical assets suffer too – real estate being a prime example.\r\n\r\nBut one asset that remains reliable even in the face of recession, is gold bullion. This is a very popular choice among people who want to keep their investments safe and let them grow slowly and steadily (i.e. the average Joe) but it’s also a great option for people who are right now predicting a severe economic crisis.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not just gold that you need to consider. The same also goes for other precious metals like silver and platinum. In fact, precious metals will often actually increase in value even as other assets struggle. So, can any of these options give gold a run for its money?\r\n\r\n**Gold v. Silver**\r\n\r\nMany articles will focus purely on gold investments and generally this is the more popular option. However, investing in silver also has its own unique benefits<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nIn particular, silver has a comparatively lower value per unit than other precious metals. What this means is that you can afford to invest in silver even if you don’t have as much capital to invest. This in turn means that silver is much more accessible for individual investors.\r\n\r\nIf you invest the same amount of money into silver as you would for gold, this then also gives you more options regarding the way you want to use it. Essentially you will be able to sell it off in smaller units allowing you to sell/keep more precise percentages of your investment.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth bearing in mind that the values of both gold and silver do fluctuate from time to time. Having both can give you a more diverse portfolio which ultimately is safer than keeping all your eggs in one basket as it were. It also allows you to take advantage of changes the value of either. This is a concept that anyone who has invested in stocks and shares will be familiar with.\r\n\r\n**Platinum and Palladium**\r\n\r\nThen you have the option of platinum and palladium. Things are getting complicated!\r\n\r\nPlatinum of course is a precious metal that is highly practical (unlike gold which is soft, heavy and not at all conductive). It is commonly used for designer jewelry but also in all manner of other applications – including in the automobile industry. The popularity of platinum is largely due to its resilience and it’s very hard to scratch it. Powdered platinum is meanwhile used as a catalyst in the ignition of your car!\r\n\r\nPalladium meanwhile is part of the platinum group but is slightly different. It is commonly used as an alloy along with platinum in the jewelry business and it is often seen as a good low-cost alternative. Both options are popular among investors owing to their rarity and their usefulness. Bullion is often available in 10-ounce bars with some beautiful designs.\r\n\r\nPalladium is currently considered to be a hot prospect, poised to grow quickly over the coming years<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\n**What Should You Invest In?**\r\n\r\nSo now the big question… which of these wins?\r\n\r\nWell, if you were only to invest in _one_ precious metal, gold would be advisable for those with the money. Why? Because it is the most valuable and it is highly rare. It’s also what our money is actually based on. The supply is the least likely to change and this also makes it the most stable option.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have enough money to buy gold though, silver might be a better entry point and a good way to start out with investing in precious metals.\r\n\r\nBest of all though? Diversify your portfolio with _both_ types of previous metal! And while you’re at it, why don’t you also throw in a little platinum and palladium? Especially seeing as these are the two metals that are most likely to see their value go _up_ as demand increases.\r\n\r\nAnd then you can start thinking even further outside the box. Why not invest in some bitcoin just to mix things up? How about art and wine?\r\n\r\nDiversity is the spice of a good investment strategy!\r\n\r\n1.

It has never been more affordable to buy a new car, and buyers can expect to land some massive deals as a result.\r\n\r\nBut why exactly are car prices at an all-time low right now? How can you best take advantage of this huge price dip? And what else do you need to know before you buy?\r\n\r\nRead on, and we’ll look into the phenomenon so that you can start to take full advantage of it!\r\n\r\n## Why New Cars Need to Compete With Uber and Better Transport Links\r\n\r\nThere are a number of factors influencing the low price of cars. One of these is simply supply-and-demand. Right now, fewer people than ever before are investing in automobiles, which in turn is owing to changes in the way we get around. Improved public transport and a higher number of transport links – especially among larger cities – is causing many people to take the bus or the train instead.\r\n\r\nCity dwellers in particular will also find that roads are packed with vehicles and that they can actually often get around _quicker_ by using these other options! Uber has made an impact too: ensuring that there is always a ride available for an affordable price when you need it.\r\n\r\nThe general view of automobiles has also soured over time. No longer is this an exciting new technology, or a symbol of freedom and empowerment. Today, cars are associated with greenhouse gasses and harmful emissions. Electric vehicles and ride sharing are therefore becoming much more popular, leaving car dealers and manufacturers eager to try and shift their inventory.\r\n\r\n## Lifestyle Factors\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, fuel prices have been going up and up and it has become easier than ever to attain second-hand vehicles for less (which is thanks to a lot of car recycling sites).\r\n\r\nThen there is the small matter of the economy. Right now, the average citizen – especially young person – has less money to spend than they have done previously. This is owing to the lack of available jobs, not to mention soaring costs of living. Many people simply can’t afford to renew their cars as often as they previously have, especially as a new car is often considered a luxury.\r\n\r\nOf course, a car itself is often _not_ a luxury, but seeing as you can use a second-hand vehicle, or just avoid exchanging vehicles as frequently, there are still plenty of ways to get around and to bring your shopping/luggage with you. And of course, seeing as cars are better built than before, they also tend to last longer – further reducing the need to upgrade over time.\r\n\r\n## Manufacturing\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is the simple fact that technology _tends_ to become cheaper with time. Consider your average 4K television. There was a time that this would have been a purchase for thousands of dollars, but today it’s significantly more affordable. In fact, the average television is now a 4K television!\r\n\r\nThe same goes for automobiles. Today, it is easier than ever before to source parts, while factories and assembly lines are more efficient than ever before. Of course, many newer vehicles include additional features like self-parking and the like, but if you’re _just_ looking for a basic car, you can get one for much less than ever before.\r\n\r\nWith all these different factors playing a role, it’s no surprise that car prices are dropping. With more inventory, manufacturers and sellers are encouraged to lower prices in order to shift stock. And with costs going down, it’s also easier for them to make the sale.\r\n\r\n## How to Take Full Advantage\r\n\r\nIf you want to take advantage of these lower prices, there are a few things to consider.\r\n\r\nFirst: even though you might not need to upgrade your car right now, you should potentially consider doing so simply so that you can take advantage of these extremely low rates.\r\n\r\nLikewise, you need to know where to look. Keep in mind that car manufacturers often don’t want to advertise their best deals alongside their other inventory, as they can end up cannibalizing their own sales! Instead, they will often use remarketing and other advertising to show the cheapest deals to prospective buyers that have since left the website.\r\n\r\nRemarketing means that a website will place a tracking “cookie” on your computer, both so that they can store your log in details and so that other websites can see that you have visited there. This allows advertising to show you things that you might be interested in. _Such as_ a car that you perhaps looked at for a while but didn’t buy, now for a much lower price!\r\n\r\nSigning up to mailing lists can also help you to spot those lower deals.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, car prices are dropping, and if you know where to look and how to take advantage of the trend, you can land yourself some amazing deals.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nSleep is one of the single most important factors when it come to our overall health, happiness, and longevity. Simply: if you aren’t getting enough sleep, you aren’t performing optimally in terms of your alertness and focus, _or_ in the gym. Lack of sleep leads to car accidents, arguments with loved ones, impulsive behaviors, impotence, high blood pressure, brain damage, and _much_ more<sup>1</sup>. And while there are countless different hacks and strategies for improving sleep, the best option is still perhaps the most straightforward: invest in a better mattress. And _exchange_ that mattress on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nWith the right mattress, you’ll be able to sleep far more comfortably and also more deeply. That means you’ll drift off faster, but also enjoy a more rejuvenating rest. You’ll jump out of bed feeling better than you have done in years.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true if you’re currently making do with the same mattress you’ve had for the past 10 years! (Which is roughly how often you should change mattresses as a minimum).\r\n\r\n## Why You Need to Change Mattresses\r\n\r\nOne reason it’s so important to exchange mattresses from time to time, is that they will lose their bounce and their original shape over time. There are roughly three types of mattress:\r\n\r\n- Memory foam\r\n- Spring\r\n- Hybrid (which combines both)\r\n\r\nSome people will prefer memory foam, whereas others prefer spring mattresses. The issue to keep in mind though is that both types will degrade over time and become flatter and harder. Springs are particularly bad in this way, as they can eventually break through the mattress or lose their pressure. Either way, you end up with uneven support that can hurt your back – a particularly important consideration for more elderly buyers.\r\n\r\nThis loss of bounce and support becomes even more of an issue at the edges of the mattress. “Edge support” is a key consideration when choosing any new mattress, and a lack of it will result in a mattress that sags at the edges and causes you to roll off onto the ground!\r\n\r\nOther issues can affect mattresses too. Memory foam mattresses can be prone to moisture issues and even mold for instance!\r\n\r\n## How to Choose a New Mattress\r\n\r\nWhen you choose a new mattress, there are a number of things to consider. The first is whether you would prefer memory foam, spring, or hybrid.\r\n\r\nGenerally, memory foam will provide a little more support and will more evenly distribute that weight. The ideal mattress will allow the spine to remain aligned, while conforming to your natural shape. At the same time though, it should offer a little support for the lower back, to encourage the natural curvature<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of a memory foam mattress is that they offer minimal “motion transfer.” This means that when you roll over, the entire bed doesn’t wobble and shake, which means you’ll be less likely to disturb a partner. And that’s pertinent to you, because it means your partner is also less likely to disturb _you_.\r\n\r\nSpring mattresses (look for pocket spring) do have their own benefits. For example, when you choose a spring mattress it will often come with superior breathability. Because there are more gaps and larger spaces between springs, this allows air to circulate naturally. That prevents the mattresses becoming damp or smelly, and it means that you’ll be able to maintain a constant temperature more easily, especially during summer.\r\n\r\nThat latter point is _extremely_ important. This is because temperature is actually one of the most important factors in controlling our sleep wake cycle. Studies show that while indigenous tribes all wake and sleep at different times in relation to the cycle of the sun, they actually tend to be fairly consistent in rising and falling with the changing temperature.\r\n\r\n## More Factors to Consider\r\n\r\n**Edge Support:** Edge support is the aforementioned ability of the mattress to maintain firmness at the edges. This prevents you from rolling out of bed, or from experiencing discomfort when you are at an angle.\r\n\r\n**Hypoallergenic:** Particularly when choosing foam and hybrid mattresses, you can be working with a range of unusual polymers and substances. A hypoallergenic mattress is one that steers clear of any substances that might cause a reaction. Some are also antimicrobial!\r\n\r\n**Fire Retardant:** A good mattress should be fire retardant for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n**Eco Friendly Materials:** If you want to sleep easy (see what I did there) knowing that the mattress you chose is kind to the environment, try to find one that is eco-friendly.\r\n\r\n**Firmness:** Firmness is an extremely personal matter, and the perfect level of firmness for one person may be all wrong for the next. But finding the right level of firmness is very likely what will help you to find a bed that you feel comfortable in and that offers the best night of sleep. Firmness also relates to your level of discomfort and back pain however. This is why it’s always advisable to actually test the mattress wherever possible!\r\n\r\n## Box Mattresses vs Regular Mattresses\r\n\r\nIf you’re in the market for a new mattress, then you may have come across a number of advertisements for mattresses-in-a-box. These are mattresses that get delivered to your door and come flat-packed in a cardboard box. These mattresses often make a lot of claims in their marketing, promising to be the most amazing products for your back and for ensuring a good-night’s sleep. They also typically offer a 100-day trial period, and will even offer to take away your old mattress.\r\n\r\nShould you consider these deals? Or choose your own mattress from a regular bed store?\r\n\r\nThe answer is often the latter. The reason for this is that boxed mattresses come with some issues and limitations:\r\n\r\n- They come with a strange smell that can linger for weeks\r\n- They take at least 24 hours and often much longer to adjust to the correct shape once removed from the box\r\n- They are typically significantly more expensive than offline options\r\n- The marketing hype often doesn’t amount to much\r\n- Store-bought mattresses are delivered anyway!\r\n- Spring mattresses and hybrid mattresses can’t be delivered this way\r\n- You can’t lie on them in store – and returns are a hassle\r\n\r\nIn short, you will usually be better off simply trying out a mattress in store and speaking to someone there. You’ll have more option, and you’ll save money!\r\n\r\n1. _Why We Sleep_ by Matthew Walker\r\n2.

      "content": "\r\nIf you’re struggling with debt, then this can impact on every single aspect of your life. It’s a constant source of stress that actually makes it much harder to make smart financial decisions going forward. No one will offer you any good rates for loans, and any money you attempt to save will go straight toward paying off bills. Debt consolidation has an answer though, and it’s the first step many people will take to getting out of this seemingly bottomless hole. But only if you choose the right company to help you!\r\n\r\nSo just what is debt consolidation? Essentially, debt consolidation takes all of the outstanding debts you currently have and then combines them into a single loan with easy monthly repayments<sup>1</sup>. This doesn’t make your debt magically go away, but what it does is to simplify matters significantly _and_ potentially save you lots of money.\r\n\r\nThe way it does all this is by taking a single bigger loan and using that to pay off all the outstanding debts that you currently have. Now all you need to do is to pay back that one big loan, and you’ll be completely debt free! This can either happen manually (meaning that you take out a loan and then individually use the money to pay off the other loans) or automatically (meaning that a company handles all of your debt for you and you just pay them). The latter is preferable as it ensures everything will go as smoothly as possible without requiring any extra work from you.\r\n\r\nChoosing the right debt consolidation agency is key to getting this right and reaping the benefits, so keep reading to learn everything you need to know.\r\n\r\n## How Debt Consolidation Simplifies Matters\r\n\r\nIf you have 20 different loans that all need paying off, then this can become something of a nightmare just to manage. You need to remember each repayment schedule, and you need to ensure that you’re not going to accidentally miss one. You need to ensure that you have enough money in each account, and you need to keep a look out for better deals or opportunities to switch.\r\n\r\nIt’s a lot of balls to keep in the air, and for many of us it’s only a matter of time before it all comes crashing down and we’re left to pay some serious fees.\r\n\r\nWith debt consolidation, you’ll only need to worry about one monthly repayment that you will agree with the lender. This also makes a lot of other things much easier: such as debt restructuring. If you need to change the rate at which you are paying back your loans, then you can do so by speaking with just one company – instead of lots! The psychological effect of having just one loan to pay back cannot be overstated.\r\n\r\n## How Debt Consolidation Saves You Money\r\n\r\nAside from helping you to avoid fees and similar issues, debt consolidation can also save you money by letting you transfer to a loan with better terms. The aim will often be to switch to a single loan that has a much better interest rate than what you’re currently being offered. This is a feature of many debt consolidation companies, so it’s not unusual to find it.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you time your change wisely, you can use this as a great way to save even more money. For example, if the national interest rates are low, then this is a great opportunity to use debt consolidation.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you have recently improved your own credit score, then you might get offered better rates from a debt consolidation company.\r\n\r\nThis also lets you renegotiate the rate at which you are paying back the loan and how much you want to pay back each month. This can save you a huge amount of money over time.\r\n\r\n## How Debt Consolidation Improves Your Credit Score\r\n\r\nDebt consolidation can even improve your credit score. It does this by paying off your outstanding debts, which is precisely what banks want to see. Banks and lenders don’t care how you pay off loans, only that you **do** pay off loans. No matter what method you use, if you suddenly settle a whole number of different outstanding debts, then you will become far more appealing to lenders again.\r\n\r\n## How to Choose the Best Debt Consolidation Company\r\n\r\nWhen choosing a debt consolidation company, there are a few obvious things to consider:\r\n\r\n- Will the company handle the transfer of debts for you, or do you need to do this manually?\r\n- What interest rates does the company offer? When you add up all the interest of the loans you are currently paying, does this lower the total amount of interest you’ll pay back? It’s worth calculating this in a spreadsheet: there is no point switching to a loan consolidation loan if you are going to end up paying more!\r\n  - Keep in mind that different lenders may be suited to different people. For instance, if you have bad credit (which is likely), you may benefit from a bad credit loan. These often ask for collateral in the form of property (called a secured loan) or a guarantor (guarantor loan). Some companies specialize in these kinds of loans and thus can offer better rates for people who are struggling. It’s up to you whether to consider a loan that may put your property at risk.\r\n- How flexible is the company when it comes to repayment schedule? Do you want to pay the loan off quickly with large sums? Or do you want to pay it back slowly with smaller repayment? Find the company that will offer you the type of loan repayment structure that suits you.\r\n- Are there any incentives? For example, some companies will offer 0% APR for the first year.\r\n\r\nIn other words, don’t just take the first loan that you find. Look around and you may be able to get a loan consolidation that transforms your debt nightmare into a simple process of making small repayments each month.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nThere are lots of good reasons to go to further your education. But while learning about yourself and expanding your mind important factors, the primary goal most people have for their degree is to earn a healthy income after graduating. Let’s learn about some of the highest paid undergraduate degrees that you can take online, that will set you up for a life of success and wealth.\r\n\r\n## ![](/posts/Jobs.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Does a Degree Increase Your Income?\r\n\r\nThanks to the web, it is now possible for anyone to gain additional knowledge on nearly any subject. While online undergraduate degrees are still fairly expensive, they are far more affordable when there is no requirement to pay for accommodation, etc.\r\n\r\nThe first question to ask is whether taking any degree will really improve your salary once you graduate. Keeping in mind the huge amount of debt that most people will take on in order to study a bachelor’s degree, is it still going to be profitable over time?\r\n\r\nThe answer is that a bachelor’s degree will usually be profitable, but that this is never guaranteed. The salary you’ll enjoy once you finish an online course is going to be determined by a number of different factors, including the nature of the degree you completed, the amount of additional training and work you were willing to do, and even a healthy dose of luck!\r\n\r\nWhere all else is equal, most employers will prefer a candidate who has some sort of bachelor’s degree. This demonstrates a certain level of commitment, an analytic and critical mind, and the ability to work toward deadlines in a self-motivated manner. This is even truer of someone who had the self-determination to take an online degree with no-one looking over their shoulder to ensure that they completed everything on time.\r\n\r\nLikewise, many companies will consider those holding bachelor’s degrees for managerial positions where they might not have otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhere the degree is relevant to the subject matter, this can open up potential job opportunities that simply wouldn’t have been on the table before. And likewise, that could mean a promotion within your current organization.\r\n\r\nLikewise, you also shouldn’t underestimate the value of real-world experience, and of _actually_ spending time working in the environment that you are interested in.\r\n\r\n## The Best Online Bachelor Degrees\r\n\r\nIt’s also important to recognize that different degrees will lead to different types of work, that will vary considerably in their profitability. If you’re looking for the highest paid online bachelor’s degrees, then you need a degree that will prepare you for the kinds of jobs that offer the highest salaries.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples<sup>1</sup>:\r\n\r\n**Management Information Systems**\r\n\r\nThis online degree will combine management with information technology. This combination prepares the student for a host of managerial roles and business positions, while at the same time teaching them increasingly valuable technical skills in IT. Topics of study include database design, project management, network infrastructure, security, business ethics, and more. These are some of the most sought after roles in an increasingly online and data-driven business environment, making the degree extremely highly paid.\r\n\r\nAn example of a highly paid role is information systems manager, which could earn a candidate as much as $143k annually.\r\n\r\n**Computer Science/Software Development**\r\n\r\nComputer science is a broad topic that can be applied to a wide range of IT-related tasks. With a broad understanding of systems and programming, students will be able to pick up specific programming skills as needed for a wide variety of projects.\r\n\r\nSoftware development is a more vocational course meanwhile that will combine programming in specific in-demand languages, along with application UI design, and other matters pertaining to every stage of software development.\r\n\r\nSoftware development is an area that is currently growing at a rate of around 25-26% each year, making it an extremely futureproof career option. Software developers can expect to earn $104k per year as an average.\r\n\r\nGame development is also an in-demand bachelor’s degree, which can earn as much as $64k.\r\n\r\n**Marketing**\r\n\r\nMarketing is a skill that has always been in demand and that will continue to be sought after by businesses. The bottom line is that marketing is profitable for employers, which means it will be a secure option for students and employees.\r\n\r\nThe face of marketing has changed considerably in recent years, owing to the effect that the internet has had on communication. With more ways to reach an audience, this has only led to more work for marketers. Today, a marketer can expect to earn anywhere in the region of $130k.\r\n\r\n**Cybersecurity**\r\n\r\nData is the most valuable commodity in the digital age, which makes cybersecurity of chief priority for businesses that work online (that’s most of them!). Cybersecurity specialists can therefore demand $100k and even more, making this a very profitable degree.\r\n\r\n**Animation**\r\n\r\nCGI animation in particular is increasingly in-demand throughout Hollywood. So much so, that the industry has been pushed to breaking point, resulting in an actual **drop** in visual fidelity for movies in the last several years.\r\n\r\nThis is a job role that is only likely to increase in demand, making animation a smart choice for online bachelor degrees. An animator can expect a salary of around $70k a year.\r\n\r\n**Finance/Accounting**\r\n\r\nAccounting, finance, and other financial roles are still highly profitable. Again, accountants, account managers, and financial advisors can charge a lot of money because their employees/clients will make a lot of money by using their services. On average, an accountant will earn around $70k after graduating, while a personal financial advisor can charge up to $89k per year.\r\n\r\n## Is Taking an Online Bachelor’s Degree a Good Idea?\r\n\r\nMany people ask how long it takes to complete an online bachelor’s degree. The answer depends on the nature of the specific program, as well as the approach taken by the student. Typically, an undergraduate degree should take 3-4 years to complete, however the web offers accelerated courses, part-time courses, and everything in between to fit around your style of learning. Expect to dedicate at least 3 years of intensive study however. This can be a lot of pressure on top of a full-time job, and especially if you have other commitments such as a family to raise.\r\n\r\nAs long as you are willing to put in the work – which may mean additional training and experience – a bachelor’s degree will likely lead to a higher paid job, and possibly greater work satisfaction. You’ll also grow as a person, and be left with a huge sense of accomplishment once you have landed the degree.\r\n\r\nAs long as you can spare the time and the investment, taking an online bachelor’s degree is a highly worthwhile option.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nCars like the Buick Enclave, Ford Edge have lately been doing incredibly well for their respective manufacturers, and have very much set the trend for the automobile industry. At the moment, any crossover or mini SUV is almost bound to fly out of the showrooms and it seems that more and more people are converting to this way of thinking.\r\n\r\nSo what is it about these small crossover vehicles that makes them so popular? And what are the best crossover vehicles on the market right now?\r\n\r\nRead on and we’ll take a look at just why the crossover SUV is so popular in the automotive industry. In particular: how does this car save you money?\r\n\r\n## The Benefits\r\n\r\nEssentially a crossover SUV is a small car that is shaped like an SUV while still being very compact and nimble. Often, they will offer four-wheel drive but with smaller engine sizes between 1-1.5 liters typically.\r\n\r\nWhat this then gives you is a car that’s small and fun to drive around owing at least partly to its responsiveness. This, coupled with the fact that they’re highly energy efficient, means that you’ll be able to zip around urban environments without worrying about racking up a huge fuel bill or creating a lot of pollution. This is where the money-saving aspect comes in, and it’s why more and more people are choosing these cars as their daily run-arounds.\r\n\r\nInstead of driving something massive that’s expensive to run (not to mention insure and park), you’re opting for something nimble, affordable, and practical. It’s ideal for the older individual looking to save money and get around, or the young professional who does a lot of commuting.\r\n\r\nOn top of all that, the large amount of clearance you get from a crossover means that you won’t scuff the bottom of your vehicle on curbs and you’ll be able to handle potholes with aplomb. The cars are highly robust and they have a sporty look to match often.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this, these smaller SUVs tend to be good value for money in their own right, so you’ll be able to get all kinds of nice features and extras on the inside for your cash. And the option to go off-road for family days out is always a nice bonus.\r\n\r\n## The Cons\r\n\r\nBut no car is perfect for everyone so you still need to consider the drawbacks before you settle on a mini crossover SUV.\r\n\r\nFor starters, as the name suggests, these cars are pretty mini. In other words, they tend to sacrifice boot space and they can only fit in so many passengers – so you’ll need to think twice if you have a large family or you want to take lots of people in the back regularly.\r\n\r\nWhile these cars often offer four-wheel drive, they are of course not as capable when it comes to off-road capabilities as a proper full-sized off-roader (and some will struggle a great deal with even slightly rough terrain). The small engine size has to be considered here and this is also something that can be an issue if you’re driving long distances. These cars are very much aimed at urbanites.\r\n\r\nIt’s also important to ask yourself whether you like the look of the mini crossover as they are an acquired taste. Some find them a little wimpy looking owing to their small dimensions while others will find them sporty and spunky.\r\n\r\nThese cars certainly have a lot of advantages but whether or not it’s right for you will ultimately depend on your preferences and lifestyle. Take one for a spin and make up your mind!\r\n\r\nIf you do decide that the money-saving advantages of crossovers are for you, then you would do well to choose any of the best crossover cars available right now from the list below.\r\n\r\n## The Best Value Crossover Cars Today\r\n\r\n**GMC Terrain**\r\n\r\nThis is a fantastic compact SUV that stands out thanks to a plush interior. The car is in its second generation following the successful 2018 model, and comes with four different trims. The base model has a 1.5L, four-cylinder engine. It’s also very affordable and energy efficient, making it a great value proposition for those that need something like this.\r\n\r\n**Kia Sorento**\r\n\r\nKia make reliable, practical cars, and the Sorento is no different. This is an all-wheel drive Crossover with a 2.4L crossover engine. It boasts a decent EPA-estimated 22mpg when running around the city, making it a smart option for the money conscious and eco-conscious alike.\r\n\r\n**Nissan Pathfinder**\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for a crossover that has a little bit of heft behind it, then you’ll be blown away by the Nissan Pathfinder and it’s excellent 3.5L V6 engine. That generates 284 horsepower! It’s maybe not quite as efficient as others on this list though.\r\n\r\n**2020 Honda CR-V**\r\n\r\nA smart looking crossover in the electric blue, with fantastic space for both passengers and cargo. It also offers amazing efficiency with its 28MPG city estimate, and a fair asking price at just $25,050.\r\n\r\n**2020 Nissan Kicks**\r\n\r\nIf it’s the best value crossover vehicle you’re looking for, then you’ll be impressed with the wonderful $18,870 price tag on the Nissan Kicks. This car tops many lists thanks to a slew of great features, excellent performance, and VERY good efficiency for urban runs (31MPG).\r\n\r\nThis is all round a great purchase from a lifestyle standpoint and certainly from a financial standpoint!\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nBuying a home should be one of the most exciting and encouraging times in your life. You’ll be starting a life somewhere new, with more space, better facilities, and maybe even a more convenient commute. If it’s your first home, then you’ll be gaining a huge amount of freedom and responsibility, which can be intoxicating and frightening! But to make this happen you need to get a home loan first. Fortunately, understanding the criteria that a lender looks for can help you to get the best deal and the best new property!\r\n\r\nWhen a lender provides anyone with a loan, they are essentially making an investment. This works just the same as investing in stocks and shares: the lender expects the individual to pay the loan back with interest, thus meaning they’ll earn money on that investment. But at the same time, the lender also takes on a certain amount of risk: as there is always the possibility the individual won’t be _able_ to pay off the loan they’ve taken out. That in turn means that the lender might lose money, and so they need to do everything they can to ensure that whoever they give the home loan to is going to be capable of paying it off.\r\n\r\nThis is why lenders have strict criteria for giving out mortgages. (That, and because the lack of regulation in the home loans market is partly what led to the 2008 financial crisis!<sup>1</sup>)\r\n\r\nSo, precisely how does a lender make sure a borrower is likely to be able to pay off their debt? Here are some of the things they will look at:\r\n\r\n## Criteria for Home Loans\r\n\r\n**Income vs Expenses**\r\n\r\nThe primary thing that lenders will look at when considering someone for a home loan, is whether that person’s income outstrips their outgoings.\r\n\r\nIn other words: are you earning more than you are spending? To determine this, the lender will ask to see your payslips, and they will also ask to see your bank accounts in order to determine how much you typically spend. Recurring expenses such as bills will come under particular scrutiny.\r\n\r\nUsually, a lender will ask to look at statements going back at least three months. For that reason, it’s a good idea to get your finances in order _prior_ to this date. For instance, you may decide to cancel any subscription fees that you are currently committed to! Likewise, this would be a good time to _stop_ buying widescreen TVs and expensive clothes!\r\n\r\n**Employment**\r\n\r\nOf course, the previous entry on this list somewhat requires that a person be employed and earning money. It also goes a little further than this though. For instance: a bank will likely want to see that your job is stable. That means you’ll have more luck achieving a home loan should you apply once your probation period has ended.\r\n\r\nShould you be self-employed, this becomes more difficult. Now the bank is going to want to see your proof of income in the form of tax returns. Most often, they will ask to see at least three years of returns. They will also likely want to see that your income is _increasing_ rather than staying the same or growing smaller: so make sure that you keep working at your business, and avoid getting too cheeky with those expenses!\r\n\r\nOf course, it also makes a big difference if there are two of you both in employment.\r\n\r\n**Current Pot**\r\n\r\nA lender is also going to be interested to see just how much money you have managed to save, which you will likely put toward your deposit (while keeping some back as a rainy-day fund).\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have any money saved up, then this is a good opportunity to prepare for the scrutiny of a lender.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that lenders are also legally required to check the trail of any large amounts of money you have received. If you get the money from a relative, then they will need to show how they acquired it too. This is to prevent laundering.\r\n\r\n**Life Plans**\r\n\r\nA lender will also look at the circumstances surrounding a person’s lifestyle. For instance: they will want to know if you plan on having a child – even though this can seem a little invasive!\r\n\r\n**Debt and Track Record**\r\n\r\nFinally, home loan lenders will want to see your outstanding debt and your credit score. This helps them determine whether you have other outstanding financial commitments, and it also helps them to identify if you will be likely to successfully pay off _future_ debts.\r\n\r\nA credit score is formed based on your history of financial interactions: things such as your ability to pay off previous debts, or the number of old checks that have bounced.\r\n\r\n## How to Get a Home Loan With Bad Credit\r\n\r\nFirstly, you need to amass as much money as you can to put towards your deposit. The smaller you manage to make your deposit, then the more likely you are to secure a loan (as the total you are asking for will be smaller). Likewise, think about repayment structures and paying back smaller amounts over a longer period. This earns the bank more money, and also means you need less disposable income each month. Of course, it’s also more expensive in the long term!\r\n\r\nIf you have damaged your credit due to previous times of difficulty then, but are now in a position to amass some wealth, then you might be advised to wait a year to earn a deposit before you try moving. During this time, you can also attempt to repair your credit rating and there are several ways you can do this. One of the best known is to get a credit card, but to always make your payments on time. In this way you wouldn’t really be using your credit card as such, but just keeping one going to demonstrate to the systems that you are capable of making payments on time. For example, take out a credit card and use it _only_ to top up your petrol, then just make sure that at the end of every month you pay off the credit on time and efficiently.\r\n\r\nIf you need to move out immediately however then you will need more immediate measures. One option is to amass funds and repair your credit while renting, or staying at your parents or a friends’. Another is to pool your resources with someone else, and to take out a loan together on a new home which will cost you each half as much. Finally, you could rent cheaply in the interim.\r\n\r\nAll of these options are things that a bad credit home loan broker would likely recommend to you. Brokers are go-betweens who can negotiate the terms of a loan for you, and can help you to get one when you might not otherwise have been able.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to secure a home loan and struggling, you should always use a bad credit home loan broker to improve your chances. Brokers know the market extremely well, and they’ll be able to advise the best lender for you, based on your current circumstances.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nBreast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in the world. It is the leading form of cancer in American women (other than skin cancer) and also highly common in men. There is a 13% risk of any woman being diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their life (1/8). For all these reasons, it’s important to be informed about the condition, the treatment options, and the reality of the illness.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will examine those things in detail.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Breast-cancer.jpg)\r\n\r\nBreast cancer is extremely common in women then, and is also the second most common cause of cancer death in women (behind lung cancer). A woman diagnosed with breast cancer has a 2.6% mortality rate (meaning there is a 1 in 38 chance of it being fatal)<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nWhile this makes for an extremely frightening disease, it’s important to recognize that the odds are still in your favor. That’s especially true if you catch the condition early, and you follow the doctor’s instructions carefully when it comes to breast cancer treatments.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 3.5 million breast cancer survivors in the US. You can beat this!\r\n\r\n## Knowing the enemy\r\n\r\nWhen considering treatment options for any condition, it is useful to first understand the precise cause. By knowing what causes breast cancer and how it forms, you will be in a better position to choose treatment options.\r\n\r\nBreast cancer behaves in just the same way as other forms of cancer. Essentially, breast cancer is the result of mutations in the cells, which then spread and multiply throughout the body. Every cell houses its genetic code in its DNA, which in turn is located in the center (called the nucleus). When a cell multiplies, it does so by producing an exact copy of itself (mitosis), and here, DNA works as a kind of blueprint to tell the body what the new copy of the cell should look like, and what it’s function will be.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when that DNA is damaged. This then provides an inaccurate blueprint, which in turn results in a faulty copy of the cell. Seeing as the DNA is what tells the cell how to behave and perform its roles in the body, this then means that those new copies are unable to perform as they should.\r\n\r\nEvery time the cell continues to split and divide, that incorrect copy is reproduced again and again. Once there are enough damaged cells, this then leaves a whole section of the tissue as ineffective, and this is what we call a tumor.\r\n\r\nTumor cells continue to multiply and copy themselves, which is how tumors grow. Essentially, a tumor can become large enough that it prevents the organ/tissue from performing properly. When this happens, the patient will exhibit signs of illness. Eventually, the tumor may cause organ failure. The physical mass of the tumor also continues to grow unchecked, which can lead to discomfort and issues with movement and bodily functions. These lumps also provide us with the opportunity to identify the presence of cancer however – checking for lumps is one of the very best things women can do to catch breast cancer early.\r\n\r\nCancer becomes more serious still once it travels to other parts of the body. When cancer cells reach the blood, lymph nodes, nerves, or other areas, it can cause more damage and quickly spread to other areas.\r\n\r\nThe sooner breast cancer is found and treated, the better the outcomes for patients.\r\n\r\n## Breast Cancer Treatment Options\r\n\r\nThere are a number of breast cancer treatment options that a patient and doctor can discuss together. The best option for each patient will depend on the patient, the progression of the cancer, and the age/health of the patient<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common breast cancer treatments is surgery. This can be used to remove the tumor itself, or it might be used to remove the entire breast (these are called a lumpectomy and mastectomy respectively). Of course, a lumpectomy will be preferable for most women, however mastectomy becomes more important when the tumor is large enough. Some women will choose to get a preemptive double mastectomy if they know that they have a high chance of breast cancer due to their family history.\r\n\r\nMastectomies can be invasive and upsetting procedures for patients. Fortunately, there are many options to help mitigate the damage, such as nipple-sparing mastectomies which aim to keep the nipple intact. Likewise, reconstructive surgery can be used to rebuild the breast.\r\n\r\nLymph node removal and analysis may also be an option where the cancer cells are found primarily in the axillary lymph nodes.\r\n\r\nOther options include radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy involves directly radiating the affected area using x-rays. These can be used to destroy cells of all kinds, but will be aimed specifically at the cancer cells using external-beam radiation therapy. Intra-operative radiation therapy can be used during an operation.\r\n\r\nThe danger with radiation therapy, is that it can also damage the healthy cells surrounding the cancerous tissues.\r\n\r\nBrachytherapy meanwhile is a type of therapy that involves inserting radiation-emitting sources permanently into the breast tissue. This can destroy cancer cells over the course of about one year, until the “seeds” are no longer active.\r\n\r\nChemotherapy works in a similar manner but uses chemicals to destroy cells. This can have profound effects throughout the body, leading to hair loss, sickness, and weight loss. However, this can be effective in more aggressive forms of cancer.\r\n\r\nImmunotherapy is a treatment option that involves strengthening the body’s own immune system to combat cancer cells. In some cases, this can be achieved by removing blood, training cells to identify the particular patient’s cancerous tissue, and then reinserting it. Hormonal therapy (also known as endocrine therapy) is effective against many hormones that test positive for estrogen or progesterone receptors. These tumors use hormones to continue to grow, so by blocking the production of that hormone, it’s possible to prevent it from growing larger.\r\n\r\nWith so many treatment options available, it is crucial that patients speak with their physicians to find the right options for them. The sooner they begin treatment, the better their chances of a positive outcome.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nMedicare open enrollment period is here. Open enrollment runs from October 15 to December 7<sup>1</sup>. This is the only time of the year that seniors can easily make changes to their Medicare, so it’s important to be aware of these dates. Before you can make any decision around your health insurance, it’s best to research all the different options Medicare can offer and any changes that are coming up.\r\n\r\n## Medicare Plans And Changes\r\n\r\nTake some time to think about what you need from Medicare. Consider your current insurance, health expenses, and the Medicare options to choose between.\r\n\r\n## **Am I Eligible for Medicare?**\r\n\r\nMedicare coverage usually begins automatically when you turn 65 – provided you paid Medicare taxes for at least ten years. If you’re younger than 65 but have certain medical conditions or disabilities, you may also be eligible.\r\n\r\nRemember that Part A is free, but you will have to pay a monthly premium to cover other parts you choose<sup>1</sup>. So what are these parts?\r\n\r\n## **The Four Parts Of Medicare**\r\n\r\nYour coverage is separated into four parts<sup>1</sup>. Each of these offers unique services. If you’re new to Medicare or making changes to your existing coverage, be sure to evaluate each part. You don’t want to be paying for something you don’t need.\r\n\r\n### Part A\r\n\r\nMedicare Part A covers care in a hospital. This includes a semi-private room, nursing services, meals, and required medications. Stays in many kinds of hospitals, including critical-access and mental hospitals, are covered by Part A.\r\n\r\nYou will also be covered for skilled nursing facilities and home care (in certain circumstances). Your home care usually includes physical therapy and medical social services.\r\n\r\n### Part B\r\n\r\nMedicare Part B is for medical supplies and services needed to treat different conditions. Part B covers ambulance services, outpatient care, preventive services, rehabilitative services and intermittent home health services. Also, if a doctor prescribes you medical equipment, this should also be covered.\r\n\r\nIf you’re eligible for Medicare Part A, this means you’re also eligible for Part B. If you aren’t eligible for Part A, you may still be eligible for Part B if you meet certain requirements.\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike Part A, you will have to pay a premium for Part B. Usually, this premium will be deducted from your Social Security benefits.\r\n\r\n### Part D\r\n\r\nMedicare Part D covers prescription medications that aren’t covered under Medicare Parts A and B. It is optional, but you may find Part D helpful, depending on your healthcare needs.\r\n\r\nYou can get Medicare Part D through a Medicare Advantage plan that also covers Parts A and B. Alternatively, you can enroll in a Part D prescription drug plan that is unique to your region.\r\n\r\nIf you already have a Medicare Advantage plan for Parts A and B, your insurance provider should be able to add Part D to your Medicare Advantage plan during the open enrollment period.\r\n\r\n### Part G\r\n\r\nThe final part on offer is Medicare Part G. Medicare Part G plans are sometimes called Medigap. Medicare Part C and Part F are now only available to those who enrolled to Medicare before January 1, 2020. However, Medigap plans are just the same as these.\r\n\r\nMedicare Part G is close to regular health insurance. Instead of paying bills for each healthcare service, Part G has you pay a monthly fee. This is done through private insurance companies. Usually, Part G plans are handled through preferred provider organizations (PPOs) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs).\r\n\r\nIf you have a Part G plan, you have the same coverage as the original Medicare Parts A and B, plus some additional coverage.\r\n\r\n## **Changing Your Coverage**\r\n\r\nOpen enrollment gives you the chance to make changes to your coverage. There are a number of changes you can make during this period.\r\n\r\nThrough the federal government, you can get Medicare Parts A and B<sup>1</sup>. Private insurance companies can help you to set up a Part G plan or Medicare supplemental insurance plan. Your private insurance company can help you to leave Medicare or change back to Medicare. Simply speak to your plan’s representative, explain what you wish to do, and they’ll take care of it.\r\n\r\nNo matter what changes you want to make to your Medicare, the open enrollment period is the time to do it.\r\n\r\n## **Supplemental Insurance Might Be Right For You**\r\n\r\nMedicare is great, but it won’t cover all of your medical needs. Even with Medicare coverage, you may end up with a hefty medical bill. If you would prefer to have full coverage, a supplemental policy is a great choice<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nA supplemental insurance policy, through a private insurance company, can save you money in the long run, as it will pay for any additional medical expenses. Plus, most supplemental insurance plans cap out-of-pocket expenditures. This means that you won’t have to spend any more money once you’ve reached that cap, so you’ll always know what the maximum amount you’re spending will be.\r\n\r\n## **Important Medicare Enrollment Dates**\r\n\r\n**The Medicare open enrollment period runs from October 15 to December 7**. This is the time to make changes to your Medicare plan, change to Medicare or leave Medicare.\r\n\r\n</div>Don’t worry too much if you miss the open enrollment period. You can leave your Medigap plan and return to original Medicare between January 1 and February 14. You also have until February 14 to sign up for Part D. You can also sign up to Medicare from January 1 to March 31.\r\n\r\nRemember, if you leave it until after the open enrollment period, you may be charged a fee. If you miss this period, you may have to wait another year or pay a penalty, both of which are costly options. So, mark the open enrollment period in your calendar!\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nBeing in debt can be a soul crushing experience. It literally feels like the walls are closing in around you, and every minute you wait only makes matters worse. Debt consolidation, debt restructuring, and even simple budgeting _can_ help though. So if you’re looking for a way out, it’s time to take action!\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to escape from debt once and for all, follow the advice below to make it a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n## Top Ways to Break Free From Debt\r\n\r\n**Weighing Up the Options – Asking Mom and Dad**\r\n\r\nWhen you’re looking to get yourself out of debt, you will no doubt have multiple options available to you. We are going to look at a selection of them below in fact. The question then, is how you know which option to take first?\r\n\r\nThe answer should be to think about which will get you out of debt the fastest and which will ultimately have the best impact on your finances going forward. Something of a paradigm shift is needed here and it’s important to assess your priorities. In many cases, that means swallowing your pride and asking Mom and Dad.\r\n\r\nAssuming you have a Mom and Dad who can help you, this is the first port of call for multiple reasons. For starters, it means that you won’t be taking out _another_ loan to pay off your existing one (stay _away_ from payday loans). At the same time, it means that you’ll be able to get the money _immediately_ and you won’t hurt your credit score.\r\n\r\nThis is something that many people feel uncomfortable doing, because they feel like it’s asking too much, or because it feels like failing. Recognize though that being in debt is a _serious problem_ and that you have a responsibility to your family (and your future family if you’re single). In this case, swallowing your pride and inconveniencing your parents is actually by far the lesser evil. And most parents would actually agree on that. Don’t suffer in silence – take the bravest step in admitting you need help.\r\n\r\n**Budgeting**\r\n\r\nWhen you’re struggling with debt, it’s of course very important to create a budget and a plan for getting out of that debt and then to _stick_ to said plan. This is often easier said than done and it doesn’t yield _immediate_ results but it can be effective in the long-term and if your budget is comprehensive and you are strict with yourself, it can give you projections for where you will be financially in five months or five years.\r\n\r\nDo bear in mind though that there will almost always be unexpected expenses. The only truly successful budgets will be _hugely_ conservative if you have been struggling with debt over the past years.\r\n\r\n**Transferring Your Debt**\r\n\r\nThis isn’t a strategy to get you quickly out of debt so much as a small tip that can make managing your debt that little bit easier. Still though, every little bit helps so consider moving your credit card debt to new credit cards. This is a good strategy because many credit cards are interest free for the first 6 months or even the first year. By moving your debt to these cards then, you can enjoy a small break on the interest that you have to pay. What’s more, you can repeat this process again as many times as you want meaning that you will rarely have to accrue interest on credit card loans. The only difficulty is if your credit rating is too poor for banks to want to offer you a credit card.\r\n\r\n**Consolidating Your Loans**\r\n\r\nLoan consolidation basically means taking out a new loan in order to pay off all of your _existing_ loans. This can sometimes get you into more trouble but in other cases it can be a big help. The basic idea here is that by taking out one loan to pay off your others, you consolidate all those expenses into a single payment. This then means that you don’t have to worry about different amounts of money coming out of your account throughout the month and it makes budgeting that much easier as a result. At the same time, the aim with a consolidation is that the interest on that one new loan is going to be less than the sum total of interest you’re paying on all the other loans. This can also be good for your credit score because it will look as though you successfully paid off lots of smaller loans.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, loan consolidation can leave you paying higher interest overall and can be damaging to your credit rating. Before taking this option you should definitely shop around and speak to a debt advisor.\r\n\r\n**Debt Restructuring**\r\n\r\nDebt restructuring means changing the way in which you are paying back your loans. For instance, this might mean asking a lender if you can pay smaller installments for longer, or if you can freeze your interest for a little while. In other words, if the financial pressure is too great, then you simply ask your lender if you can have something of a ‘break’ for a while.\r\n\r\nWhy would banks be willing to let you restructure what you owe them? Because they’d rather you _paid_ the loan in its entirety than go bankrupt. In other words, it’s in their best interests too to help you out. Speak to your lenders then, or consider asking an advisor to do so on your behalf.\r\n\r\n**Bankruptcy**\r\n\r\nThese days, bankruptcy is increasingly becoming a legitimate option for getting out of debt. It’s devastating for your credit score, so you should certainly consider it a last option but it forces your lenders to restructure your debt and it means you get help with your loans from the state. Bankruptcy is a better choice for businesses than it is for individuals but more and more people are choosing to go this route.\r\n\r\nConsider this a ‘last resort’ then – but it can be reassuring still to know that the worst case scenario is still livable!\r\n\r\n## Student Loans\r\n\r\n**What is Debt Forgiveness?**\r\n\r\nOn the face of it, student loan forgiveness is just what it sounds like. This is an opportunity to get some money _back_ from your loan<sup>1</sup>. Often it’s not the entire thing – just a portion – but it’s certainly better than nothing and can make a big difference to your lifestyle if you’re currently paying back large sums of money every month.\r\n\r\nSo this ‘too good to be true’ sounding deal actually _is_ true. And it’s a good idea to wake up to that fact and not write it off without looking into it! But at the same time, it’s also important to read on and learn everything about it that you can. There are certainly some caveats to bear in mind here and it will help a great deal to know what those are before you leap in with both feet!\r\n\r\n**How to Apply for Debt Forgiveness**\r\n\r\nSo how do you go about getting debt forgiveness?\r\n\r\nEssentially, the way this works is that you take on a new job – and that job offer debt forgiveness. To get the forgiveness then, you need to take that position.\r\n\r\nSometimes this will mean volunteering but this isn’t going to be a good option for most people seeing as they will have other financial commitments.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can apply for a proper position though with a paid salary. A common example of a type of job that offers this is public service. If you work for federal or local government, or a non-profit organization that is tax-exempt, then you may be able to escape some of your loan.\r\n\r\nOther jobs also offer loan forgiveness though. For instance, the automotive aftermarket industry has the SEMA program, while there is also a teach loan forgiveness program.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are many different ways to combat debt. The most important step is simply to take action today though. Move your cards if you can, look into student loan forgiveness… but more importantly just _start paying off_ debts today. Start saving money. Cancel bills. Be proactive! Even the longest journey is made up of lots of tiny steps.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nPsychology is the study of the human mind, and is a particularly fascinating topic for many people. All of us want to understand more about what makes us and other people tick, and a degree in psychology can potentially provide some amazing insight into that question.\r\n\r\nBut before you go ahead and sign yourself up, it’s important to understand more about what a psychology degree will actually entail. What career opportunities will this qualification provide? Is it a sought after degree? And what skills and knowledge will you gain?\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Psychology-degree.jpg)\r\n\r\nRead on, and we’ll address everything you need to know about getting a psychology degree in 2020.\r\n\r\n## What Does a Psychology Degree Involve?\r\n\r\nFirst, let’s take a close look at precisely what a psychology degree actually involves.\r\n\r\nThere are actually two types of undergraduate psychology program. These are: BS (bachelor of science) and BA (Bachelor of Arts). A BS degree takes a more scientific approach, with heavier emphasis on research methods, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology. Conversely, a BA will rely more on interpretation and comprehension, with greater emphasis on psychodynamic theory and philosophy.\r\n\r\nAlready you might be feeling a little lost!\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, that the BS program is by far the more common, the better respected, and the best in terms of career prospects.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of related degrees that you can take that may focus on specific areas of psychology, or tangentially related topics. These include: sociology, health psychology, neuroscience, etc.\r\n\r\n**Aspects of Studying Psychology**\r\n\r\nTo better understand the dichotomy, consider that – like any subject – psychology can be broken down into many smaller subjects and approaches<sup>1</sup>. These commonly include:\r\n\r\n- Behavioral psychology – This is a “school” of psychology that believes we learn primarily by forming associations. The model is generally thought to be incomplete today, but it is nevertheless still a useful component to consider.\r\n- Cognitive psychology – A more modern approach to understanding the human brain, that looks at the role of our inner narrative, and the processes our brain uses to understand information.\r\n- Health psychology – This field is concerned with the role of psychology in health outcomes. How should a doctor approach a patient? How can patients be better motivated to complete their courses of medication?\r\n- Social psychology – Social psychology looks at the influence of those around us on our behavior and beliefs. For example, can social influence make a person more or less aggressive?\r\n- Sports psychology – This field is concerned with the role of psychology in sports performance. How do things like confidence and focus influence athletic performance?\r\n- Developmental psychology – Developmental psychology focuses on the brain as it develops, looking at distinct stages children go through, and what this can tell us all about our own brains.\r\n- Forensic psychology – Forensic psychology is focused on the psychology of criminals, and how it can be used to aid an investigation.\r\n- Neuroscience – Also called biological psychology, this focuses on the physical and chemical structure of the brain.\r\n- Evolutionary psychology – A school of thought that focuses on the role of evolution in shaping the human mind.\r\n- Psychodynamic theory – The approach to psychology put forward by Freud and his contemporaries. Breaks the mind into three distinct entities and relies on the influence of unconscious beliefs.\r\n- Clinical psychology – This involves the use of other\r\n- Research methods – Also called experimental psychology, this is the study of the scientific method as applied to psychology. You will learn how to conduct research by collecting data, analyzing data for significance, and writing up reports.\r\n\r\nStudents will study a number of these areas at any given time, and will be required to complete tests and write essays for marking. Students will also be required to conduct their own research, demonstrating their ability to collect data (being mindful of confounding variables and other errors that could result in unclean data), and to objectively critique their own findings.\r\n\r\n## Is a Psychology Degree Right for You? Choosing the Right Course\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in taking a psychology degree because you think you’ll learn to influence the thoughts of others, or “read minds,” then you are likely to be disappointed. Likewise, you will learn little practical advice for dating, leading, or handling conflicts.\r\n\r\nPsychology as a subject offers very few “hard” answers, with every theory being cast into doubt by a lot of research. While some aspects of a psychology degree are fascinating, others may seem boring or even tedious. Your job is to learn how to study the human mind, and how to analyse findings in order to find flaws.\r\n\r\nWhile this may not make you into Sherlock Holmes, what it does is to help develop an analytic and logical mindset, and to provide skills such as comprehension, essay writing, data collection, statistical analysis, and more. This results in a particularly well-rounded graduate, and an attractive prospect for many employers.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure you will enjoy the course, it is important to carefully read the modules that are involved and what amount of freedom you will have in choosing to pursue areas that interest you most. If you wish to become a sports psychologist for instance, then you should look for a degree that includes this module. You will also benefit from health psychology, clinical psychology, and neuroscience.\r\n\r\n## Employment Opportunities\r\n\r\nIn particular, many positions will benefit from the statistics you’ll learn from your research methods modules, as well as the literacy required for essay writing. There is also an assumption that someone with a psychology degree will hold good interpersonal and communication skills, which are essential for any workplace.\r\n\r\nCommon roles and industries that can benefit from a psychology degree therefore include<sup>2,3</sup>:\r\n\r\n- Data analyst (may require additional on-the-job training)\r\n- Human resources\r\n- Sales/Marketing manager\r\n- Administrative assistant\r\n- Logistics manager\r\n- Site manager\r\n- Teacher\r\n- Play specialist (will require additional training)\r\n- Accounts manager\r\n- Research assistant\r\n- Customer service representative\r\n\r\nThe broad range of skills provided by this degree mean that it can provide an advantage when applying for nearly any kind of work.\r\n\r\nIn general, psychology is a highly sought-after qualification, with employment rates being particularly high.\r\n\r\n### Jobs Relating to Psychology Degrees\r\n\r\nIf you are surprised to learn that many people with psychology degrees go on to fulfil general office job roles, that is likely because additional/further education is generally required for many of the more specific job roles.\r\n\r\nWith further training, a psychology degree can lead to a position as a:\r\n\r\n- Speech and language therapist\r\n- Clinical psychologist\r\n- Therapist\r\n- Counselor\r\n- Sports psychologist\r\n- Neuroscientist\r\n- Researcher\r\n- Industrial-organizational psychologist\r\n- Psychiatrist\r\n- School psychologist\r\n\r\nAs a sports psychologist, you could be earning over $100,000 a year, while a clinical psychologist can earn $115,000 and above<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that these positions will typically require at least a Master Degree (MA) and likely a PhD. These qualifications require years of additional study, and large financial investments. They are also extremely competitive options.\r\n\r\n### Closing Comments\r\n\r\nWhatever your goals, a psychology degree is a worthwhile and rewarding qualification. This could lead to a high-paying office job, it could be the start of a specialist career, or it might just be a fascinating insight into the study of the human mind.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nFor most of us to get the cars and vehicles we want, auto financing is an absolute necessity. While some of us might have enough capital to buy a car outright (or certainly a used car), very few of us will have the amount of money necessary to outright buy the cars we **really want**. And this is a real shame, when you consider the huge amount of time most of us spend in our cars (not to mention how important it is that they be completely safe). So why not use auto financing and car loans to afford a vehicle that will be safer, and that will make you happier?\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Auto-loan-car-of-your-dreams.jpg)\r\n\r\nRead on and learn more about how all this works.\r\n\r\n## Why Car Financing?\r\n\r\nAs we’ve already discussed, many of us will require car financing in order to afford the kind of vehicle that we really want. While this might seem like a luxury, a newer car can actually help to keep you safer, save money on gas and servicing, and more. A newer car will also retain more of its value when you trade it in (though you should NEVER think of a car as an investment), and it will keep you from tearing your hair out when you are sat in queues for long periods of time. Then there’s the fact that your vehicle actually helps people to form their first impressions of you when you arrive anywhere. Whether it’s an interview, date, or corporate event, think about the kind of car you want to arrive in!\r\n\r\nBy using some form of car financing you are able to avoid taking a large amount out of your bank account and that then means that you can have more money for the day to day costs of living. The right financing will allow you to manage repayments in a way that is convenient for you, and that helps you to continue living comfortably.\r\n\r\n## Auto Loans vs Your Other Options\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many different ways to finance a new auto purchase and car loans are far from the only option available to you. Alternatively, you could rent a car or buy the car on finance so that you pay the garage or showroom in set installments rather than in one larger amount.\r\n\r\nThe best way to get financing for your car is to use car loans, and there are various reasons for this which we will look into here.\r\n\r\n**Renting Your Vehicle**\r\n\r\nFirst, let’s look at renting. This is a great way to get nice cars that you can’t afford and in many ways it also liberates you from the stresses and responsibilities of owning a car too. It is not your place to remember tax and often even insurance will come included.\r\n\r\nHowever, using vehicle loans is still preferable in this case because it means that at the end of the day, the car is yours and you can do what you want with it. This might include things like repainting it, or painting the doors. Meanwhile because you are renting the car you will pay more for it – think about it, if this wasn’t the case then the company would have just sold it themselves. With a car rental the longer you have the car for, the more it is going to cost you. On top of this there are limitations in the cars you can get near you, and there is the fact that you won’t be able to recoup _any_ of your expense as you would with a purchase by selling it.\r\n\r\n**Buying on Finance**\r\n\r\nAnother form of vehicle financing is to buy on finance and that basically means that you pay in monthly installments to the car loans company rather than paying in one go with car loans. This is again not a wise move because you will be paying a higher percentage on top of the purchase by buying on finance, and because it will be less flexible. Most importantly though, when you buy something on finance you are not going to be able to ever restructure the loan – and if you then need to make changes to the way you pay it back you won’t be able to. This means no forgiveness or flexibility and usually harsh penalties.\r\n\r\nCompared with these options, an auto loan will allow you to save money, own more of your vehicle, and enjoy the most flexible payment plans<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n## Understanding Car Loans and Bad Credit\r\n\r\nWhile many of us will use these car loans and consider it to be an everyday occurrence, not everyone understands how they work, how they make their money, or where credit ratings come into play. By understanding these factors, it is possible to better manage your money and to be more efficient in getting the cheapest loans and making sure you always pay them back. Here we will look in more detail at how car loans work and why bad credit is such a turn off for lenders.\r\n\r\n**How Car Loans Work**\r\n\r\nEssentially car loan companies are investment companies that invest in _people_ like you just as other companies such as banks will invest in stocks and shares. The idea is that people generally generate income – through their work etc. – and this means that investing in a person is a good way to make returns and grow your funds.\r\n\r\nThus, when a lender provides you with a car loan, they include interest and this is the amount extra that you need to pay back on your loan. Unlike stocks and shares then the money you will make for the lenders is nearly guaranteed and measurable. However, like any investment there is of course _some_ element of risk, and this is due to the simple fact that some people can fail to pay back their loans due to financial difficulty. This means then that a car loan company has to protect itself and avoid making bad investments on people who will lose money rather than earn it.\r\n\r\nTo this end, lenders all banded together to create the credit history system. This then is a record that is accessible by all loan companies which contains your track record for paying off debt. In other words, if you have so far payed off all the money you owe on a regular basis and met all deadlines then it will be good. If you have failed to meet repayments or have failed to pay back a loan altogether then it will be bad and lenders won’t want to offer you the money. This is a bit like analyzing the movement of stock – if a stock has shown steady decline in the past, then it would be unwise for most investors to make a purchase.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are some companies out there who cater to individuals with bad credit as this is a niche market where there is less competition. These bad credit auto loans offer the same service as other lenders but include those with bad credit. To make up for this however they charge more – this way the profit that they make from those who manage to pay back is greater and that means that they compensate for those investments that don’t go to plan.\r\n\r\nThere are also steps you can take to improve your credit score and to thereby reduce the cost of car loans. These options include taking out small loans and being sure to pay them back regularly, paying back any outstanding debt you already have, and even disconnecting your name from previous housemates that may be harming your score<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nTake these steps, and an auto loan will be an almost guaranteed way to enjoy a more luxurious vehicle and safer journeys, while only making manageable repayments each month.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nIf you’re looking to save cash on bills, then reducing your cable and internet expenses is often a great place to start. This is a non-essential expense (unlike heating) and one that is very flexible when it comes to adjusting precisely how much you pay and what you get in return.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that a LOT of people pay by far over the odds for their internet and are still unhappy with the outcome! There are better deals out there, so keep reading.\r\n\r\n## How to Get Cheaper Internet\r\n\r\nLet’s start with internet. And a good question to begin with is: just how fast does your Wi-Fi need to be?\r\n\r\n### Internet Speeds Explained\r\n\r\nThe truth is that most of us don’t need super fast speeds, whatever the advertising tries to tell us. As long as your internet is fast enough to stream TV and movies – which most basic packages should now be able to handle – then you are probably set.\r\n\r\nSure, if you are a professional YouTuber who uploads lots of high quality videos to the web, then you might want slightly faster speeds. And maybe if you have a huge family, you could do with a little more bandwidth to prevent things grinding to a halt.\r\n\r\nBut for 99% of people, expensive upgrades to internet speeds aren’t going to hugely improve quality of life.\r\n\r\n**How Much Speed Do You Need?**\r\n\r\nInternet speeds are measured in megabits per second, with one megabit being equal to 1,024 kilobits. Broadband is anything with download speeds over 768 kbps and upload speeds over 200 kbps.\r\n\r\nMany basic packages start at 25-36 mbps, which is more than fast enough for reliable gaming, video streaming and more. Normally the same package will land you about 2 mbps<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n“Do I really need this?” is a good question to ask generally when considering your cable and internet costs.\r\n\r\n### Think About Packages\r\n\r\nA lot of Internet Service Providers (“ISP”) will try to get you to take out extensive packages with them that include things like landline rental, cable, TV channels, and more. In some cases, this can be a good deal that saves you cash by bundling services that you would have paid for separately. In other cases, you can end up paying for things you hardly use, which will cost you a lot of money!\r\n\r\nCable and internet are sometimes better off being divided, so don’t just stick with the first bundle you get offered!\r\n\r\n### Look Out for Deals\r\n\r\nAs with any service or product, you can often save money on internet by looking out for deals. ISPs are always trying to attract new customers to their brands, so they will offer discounts and sales to try and lure them in. This can of course be a great time for you to sign up!\r\n\r\n### Watch Out for Price Creep\r\n\r\nThat said, you do need to check the small print when you sign up for any cable and internet deal. That’s because a lot of providers will tie you in for long term contracts and then slowly increase the price. They’re allowed to do this as long as it is stated in the contract, and this can end up putting you on a much worse deal! Be careful!\r\n\r\n### Stop Renting Your Router\r\n\r\nThe router is the device you use to connect to the web, and it is often actually “on loan” from the provider. You therefore pay extra for the privilege of using it, and if you ever lose it or move home, you can end up getting charged!\r\n\r\nIn the long term, it’s more cost effective to invest in your own router, and then forego the additional monthly expense. What’s more, is that you’ll often get better service too! And you’ll recoup the expense within the first three months in most cases.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Pay Twice\r\n\r\nIf you have a mobile phone with 4G internet access, then you’re probably paying quite a lot for that per month. A lot of cellular network providers will try and sell you ridiculous amounts of data per month, or even unlimited data!\r\n\r\nIn truth, unless you plan on streaming movies every morning on the train, you certainly don’t need 90GB of data. And even then, you can probably connect to the train’s Wi-Fi anyway!\r\n\r\nIf you’re already paying a lot for your Wi-Fi back home, cut the amount of data you use on mobile, and rely on that instead!\r\n\r\n### Switch\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been with the same provider for years, then chances are that there are better deals out there. These companies rely on us being too busy to think about switching, and so they don’t feel the need to provide the best deals – and the bigger companies are usually the worst culprits for this! Shop around and check out the competition and then consider switching.\r\n\r\nThe best part is that when you call up your ISP to let them know you’re planning on switching, they will often start offering you even better deals just to keep you on board!\r\n\r\nIf you want a little more ammo, you can also try downloading apps to test your internet speeds. You’ll find that they often don’t match up to what you’re promised, and if you point this out, you may be able to get some money back!\r\n\r\n## How to Save on Cable\r\n\r\nNow you have cheaper internet, the next step is to start getting your entertainment for less too. Here are some tips to cut down your cable bill.\r\n\r\n### First: Do You Really Need Cable?\r\n\r\nThe first question to ask yourself is whether you really need cable in 2020. Cable and internet are often packaged together, but in truth you can usually get most of the same television online. Investing in an Amazon Fire Stick and a Netflix account will give you access to limitless movies, and a lot of streaming services and TV channels.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself how many of the cable channels you watch on a regular basis, and whether this is really worth the amount you are paying monthly for them!\r\n\r\n### Scrutinize the Extras\r\n\r\nIf you do decide that cable and internet are a good idea for you in 2020, then you need to think about what you need specifically<sup>2</sup>. Once again, cable companies like to try and get you to sign up for as many extras as possible, which often includes things like secondary set-top boxes for the spare room, or DVR (which is increasingly less necessary as everything is available on demand).\r\n\r\n### Deals and Shopping Around\r\n\r\nAs with your ISP, you can often drive down the price of cable by simply shopping around, looking for deals, and cutting providers. You also shouldn’t be afraid to call up your provider and tell them that you need a lower price. You’d be surprised how quickly cable and internet companies will bend over backward to keep you on board!\r\n\r\n## Conclusions: How to Save on Cable and Internet\r\n\r\nAs you can see then, there are many ways to start getting your cable and internet for less. The key is simply to be proactive when it comes to shopping around, and not to settle for a sub-par deal just because it’s easier. Demand a better service!\r\n\r\n1 [Internet speed classifications: What’s fast, what’s slow, and what is a good internet speed?](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/internet-speed-classifications-what-is-fast-internet)\r\n\r\n2 [How to Save Money On Cable in 2019 – Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisbrantner/2019/02/28/how-to-save-money-on-cable-in-2019/#e53709f63871)\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n2020 has been stressful to say the least – with 2021 now here, wouldn’t you love to be relaxing somewhere right now holding one of those tiny umbrella drinks? That doesn’t have to be a pipedream. It can be your reality with a little bit of planning and research. Because of the economic slowdown, there has literally never been a better time to check for prices of unsold cruise cabins. There are plenty of options and a ton of savings out there if you do enough research.\r\n\r\nYou might think that there’s no way you could afford a cruise…But now it’s easier than ever to get a great deal thanks to the growing supply of cruise ships – and the shrinking demand for cruises.\r\n\r\n## Why Is Now The Best Time to Take A Cruise?\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, cruise companies have spared no expense and literally invested billions of dollars in awe inspiring super ships.<sup>1</sup> Unfortunately for the cruise companies (but luckily for you), it seems like they have timed their expansion badly! Because of the recent economic slowdown, cruise ships haven’t been handling as many passengers. As many as 1 million less people traveled on cruises in 2017.<sup>2</sup> Because ships don’t always fill up, savvy travelers can now enjoy these formerly “once-in-a-lifetime” cruises at insanely affordable prices.\r\n\r\nHow does up to 70% off<sup>3</sup> the brochure price sound? Believe it or not, it’s possible by searching for these deals. Because there is a new huge supply of rooms on mega-ships, but a low demand for cruises – you get a good price on the vacation of a lifetime.\r\n\r\n## How Do These Discounts Work?\r\n\r\nRunning a cruise ship has huge overhead!Ships need to be stocked with tens of thousands of dollars in food. Your waiters, entertainers, crew, and captain all need to be paid their salaries. Not to mention, cruise companies already have a lot of money tied upfront by building these super-ships. Because of the huge costs involved in building and operating today’s luxury ships, cruise lines want their ships to sail with as few empty cabins as possible.\r\n\r\nMost cruise lines don’t want to widely advertise how low they’re willing to price their cabins… But in order to get every cabin booked, sometimes they have to lower prices. So to save money and get the cruise of your dreams, you just need to do some homework! Cruise companies need to fill their remaining empty cabins before their ships depart.\r\n\r\nEven selling a cabin at a discount prevents the cruise company from losing money…That’s why you can find so many great cruise deals when you know the right places to look.\r\n\r\n## Why Aren’t People Cruising?\r\n\r\nThere are a few main reasons people are taking fewer cruises:\r\n\r\n- The economy\r\n- Cruises haven’t mastered the Millennial market\r\n\r\nEven though we’re out of “The Great Recession” were experiencing a downturn in 2020 and things haven’t recovered…US economic growth has slowed down significantly several times since 2008. There were slowdowns in:\r\n\r\n- 2011<sup>4</sup>\r\n- 2012<sup>4</sup>\r\n- 2014<sup>4</sup>\r\n- 2015<sup>4</sup>\r\n- 2017<sup>5</sup>\r\n- 2020<sup>5</sup>\r\n\r\nWith that rocky road, not many people feel confident buying luxuries like cruises… Which helps you get great deals on cabins.\r\n\r\nOn top of a bumpy economic ride, the cruise industry has struggled to get Millenials interested.<sup>6</sup> This is increasingly becoming a problem for cruise companies because Millennials are the biggest buying cohort in America today.<sup>7</sup>Luckily, the cruise company’s loss is your gain – because now you can take the vacation of a lifetime at a fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\n**Where Will You Go?**\r\n\r\nNow you know why there’s never been a better time to go on a cruise, so set sail for adventure!\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nA some point, most drivers will need to buy a new set of tires. For the safety of the driver and their passengers, it’s very important to replace tires before they age or wear down below the recommended tire tread depth.\r\n\r\nRetail tire stores are notorious for charging you MSRP when the same tire can purchased online for less. You probably won’t want to spend hundreds or possibly thousands of dollars on a new set of quality tires when there are many deals and offers available if you research and shop online.\r\n\r\n## The Importance of Good Tires\r\n\r\nOne of the major parts of any car is its tires. Tires are continuously in contact with the pavement and provide performance, reliability, and safety to the driver. Unfortunately, a driver never knows what they may encounter when driving – from hitting a pothole, to running over nails, hitting an object on the road, and more. These situations can happen at any time and without warning. Over time, tires can become under-inflated and then they are more prone to blow-outs, which could be disastrous to you, your passengers, and other vehicles around you.\r\n\r\nEven if you’re lucky and don’t have a blow-out, worn tires decrease fuel mileage. As they age, tires create more friction on the road and drag more, thereby reducing fuel efficiency. Keep in mind that tires are responsible for a vehicle’s performance, just like a car’s engine. If a car has worn out tires, it doesn’t matter what’s under the hood. According to NHTSA, a driver can improve their car’s gas mileage by 0.6% on average, up to 3% in some cases, by keeping the tires inflated to the proper PSI level. While this may not appear to sound like a lot, the loss in efficiency can add up over time and result in spending more money at the pump. The bottom line is that properly inflated tires are safer and last longer.\r\n\r\nLastly, old worn tires may affect a car’s handling and traction. A tire’s gripping power can also be compromised even if the tires meet the minimum tire tread depth. While this may not be an issue when driving under normal weather conditions, it can pose a real danger in inclement wet weather and cause your auto to hydroplane out of control.\r\n\r\n## Saving Money on New Set of Tires\r\n\r\nAs you can see, getting a new set of tires is extremely important, but they are also a considerable expense. You may get some sticker shock when you start shopping for a new set of tires.\r\n\r\nTire buying can be a complicated process. So, what’s the easiest ways to save money? The first way you may not have thought of – negotiate a lower price with the tire shop. Most tire salesmen start off with their suggested retail price and then move down from there. It never hurts to ask for a break. Consumer Reports found that 70% of the people who negotiated saved an average of $29 per tire off the advertised price. Also, if you shop locally, the tire shop may throw in a road-hazard warranty and/or a lifetime tire rotation.\r\n\r\nPurchasing a new set of tires on-line is another way to save money. Since on-line stores don’t have the same overhead as your local tire shop, they can pass on their savings to you, the consumer. Why not buy on-line and have the tires shipped to your local tire installer? According to Consumer Reports, the installation cost is about $19 per tire. Do some comparison shopping between different on-line shops and your local retailer. This way you can feel comfortable that you got the best deal. Then bring back these on-line offers to your local tire store and see if they can price match. It’s always nice to support your local community.\r\n\r\nTire companies typically run big specials during certain times of the year- spring and late fall. These are big seasons for tire companies. They try and encourage drivers to buy new winter snow and summer tires. You may see the biggest markdowns during these times.\r\n\r\n## Bottom Line: How Not to Break the Bank\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that quality equates to safety when selecting a new set of tires. It affects fuel efficiency, car handling, and safety. At the same time, you don’t want to spend more than you need. While it may be important to purchase a new set of tires for the front axle, it may not be necessary to purchase a set for your rear axle at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe tips outlined in this article are good starting points. There are many other factors to consider when selecting tires: all weather grip, length of tread wear warranty, brand, handling, braking, car recommendations, and also how long you plan on keeping your car/budget. We also recommend that you speak with your car mechanic about what tire they would recommend.\r\n\r\nThere are various tools made available to you, from online resources to speaking with local mechanics to assist you in making an informed decision. Once you have selected your tires, there are many retailers and e-tailers to choose from to make your your purchase. The best stores often have quality installation and compelling prices.\r\n\r\nProtect your investment and maintain your tires with these tips and makes sure to shop online to get the price.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nWhen was the last time you saw a SUV ad on TV? They are on all the time and the prices they advertise on TV can sometimes vary drastically from the prices advertised online.\r\n\r\nIf you go to the dealership thinking the lowest price is the one they advertised on TV, chances are you will end up paying thousands more than you need to.\r\n\r\nYou should never think TV advertised prices are the lowest – many new car dealers advertise internet only prices which can save you money (plus this is best time of year to be searching when dealers are left with no choice but to sell their unsold inventory).\r\n\r\n## Supply and Demand\r\n\r\nLet’s face it, in today’s economy, SUV sales have been down in the wake of The Great Recession. As the economy slowly got better, SUV sales picked up a little. However, that growth is now stalled and the industry is believed to have already peaked. GM and Ford, the two largest automakers in the U.S., both saw declining sales last year<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n## What Does That Mean For You As A SUV Buyer?\r\n\r\nIt means that dealerships are more desperate than ever to sell unsold SUVs on their lots. These days some SUV dealers begin getting their new year vehicles 6 months before the year ends – just making the problem worse. Each dealerships unsold inventory becomes expensive to sit on and they’re forced to either take a loss or sell it below the advertised price. Dealerships don’t want sell it at a loss, so they’re happy to make deals on SUVs to keep sales coming in. They want you as a customer!\r\n\r\n## **Getting the Best Price on Your New SUV**\r\n\r\nSo how do you get the best price on a new SUV? The first thing you’ll want to do is take a few minutes to compare online advertised deals. You should never pay the the prices on TV or the MSRP on the SUV’s window sticker. Some dealers and SUV manufacturers offer online only specials and incentives so it’s critical to begin researching the new SUV deals being advertised online before you ever step foot or a call a dealership.\r\n\r\n## **Find A Dealership With An “Internet Sales” or “Fleet Manager”**\r\n\r\nAfter you’ve done your research on all the best SUV deals advertised online, it’s important to speak to the right person at the dealership on the phone before you walk in. If you walk into a dealership or call a dealership’s normal sales department, the salesmen are typically commissioned heavily which means your SUV will cost you more!\r\n\r\nHowever, dealerships that sell a lot of volume have larger and more diversified staff who are incentivized differently like internet sales or fleet managers. They work less on commission and more on volume as they field the incoming website and brokered leads. These internet sales or fleet managers are willing to sell the SUV for less because they make more money by selling volume versus the standard sales rep on the floor. They can be the key to a great deal on a new SUV.\r\n\r\nSo once you identify the SUV you’re interested in, you’ll want to call the dealership and ask to speak with the “Internet Sales Manager”. If they say they don’t have one, ask if they have a “Fleet Manager”. If they don’t have a Fleet Manager, just hang up and call a different dealership. Smaller dealerships typically don’t have a lot of wiggle room on pricing of their unsold inventory and won’t be as inclined to discount. So if they don’t have Fleet or Internet Sales Manager, we suggest you hang up and call another dealership that has one.\r\n\r\n## **What You Need To Do Now**\r\n\r\nIf you’re in the market for a new SUV, the first thing you must do is research the current specials being advertised online. Don’t take the TV advertisements word for it. Internet online specials (as well as internet sales or fleet managers at the dealerships) can save you a ton of money. You just need to begin your search online for the best deal and then when you begin contacting dealers, ask to speak to the “Internet Sales” or “Fleet Manager” to make sure you are getting the best price available.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nAre your closets, rooms, attic space, or basement bursting at the seams? It always seems that we are running out of space in our home to store all our stuff. While we like to buy new stuff, it’s hard to part with our old sentimental things.\r\n\r\n**Solution: Rent a self-storage unit! It’s a low-cost fix and a convenient space to secure all your valuable items, without attempting to fit them in every nook and cranny in your house.**\r\n\r\n## What is a Self-Storage Unit?\r\n\r\nSelf-storage facilities are companies that allocate personal unit(s) for rent, typically on a monthly basis. There is a lot of flexibility – units range in size to meet an individual’s space requirements. Some large units can store an entire room of furniture and more, while others can be rented to store just a few items.\r\n\r\nStorage floor plans vary – units can be housed on a ground level or be in a multi-story warehouse. Since access and security are some of the key factors to consider when storing your valuables, all facilities provide a convenient and secure environment to store your belongings. Many facilities have security fences, guards, watch dogs, and cameras systems.\r\n\r\n24/7 access is also a key feature of self-storage units. Look for those facilities since you never know when you want to access your belongings or need to add more items to your unit. Most facilities allow you to use your own padlock, or they will provide you with your personal access key so you don’t have to wait for the storage unit attendant to let you in.\r\n\r\n## Why Should You Use Self Storage?\r\n\r\nSelf-storage is a great solution for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n**Reduce Clutter**  \r\nLooking for a place for stuff you don’t want to store at your house. Some of your possessions are very valuable and sentimental, but you don’t have the storage space at your house to keep them on-site. You’ll want to find a storage unit with a climate-controlled environment that regulates temperature and humidity to safely store your prized baseball card or doll collection, artwork, antiques, and other items. Some self-storage units can also store cars, motorcycles, RVs, boats, and trailers.\r\n\r\n**House Renovations**  \r\nRemodeling can take weeks or months. You may need to move appliances and furniture out of the way of the workers. Moving these valuable items to a self-storage unit temporarily is a great solution.\r\n\r\n**Military Life**  \r\nMilitary families may be on the move every couple of years to a different base. These moves can be very drastic and renting a self-storage unit can be a very useful solution during the relocation.\r\n\r\n**When you Plan to Move to a New House**  \r\nMoving is very stressful. Renting a self-storage unit is a great solution to ease that stress, especially if there is a time period gap between moving out of your old house and in to your new one. You can move your possessions into a self-storage unit for that time being without feeling stressed. This is a great solution so you can focus on fixing up your new house, laying new carpet or flooring, painting, etc. during this gap period. When you’re ready to move to your new home, just pick up your belongings from the storage unit or hire a moving truck.\r\n\r\n**If You’re Down-Sizing**  \r\nWhy not store some of your valuable possessions until you can make a decision as to what to do with those items? Self-storage is a great staging area. Take your time and sort out what items you want to pack first and then move that first load to a self-storage unit. Then tackle other areas of your home, pack up those items, and move them to the unit. You won’t clutter your old home with boxes all over the place while still trying to live there. When everything is completed and you’re ready to move to your new home, retrieve what you need or move everything in at the same time.\r\n\r\n**You’re a Recent Divorcee**  \r\nIf you’re moving out of the house you shared with your former partner, storing bulky items and furniture in a self-storage makes sense. It takes time to settle down in your new life and determine where you would like to live. This gives you additional time to find a new home and then determine what items will fit in your new abode. You may want to store some valuable and useful items if they won’t fit in your new home, but you may need them later on. This may be the best economical solution.\r\n\r\n## How to Find an Inexpensive Self-Storage Unit\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you research all the local storage unit companies in your area that meet your requirements. Perform on-line searches, read reviews, look for discounts, and speak with the people that run the facilities. While at the facility, see if there are other renters around and speak with them. Ask them about security, access, and any concerns they may have. Does the self-storage facility check all your boxes, such as having climate-control? Visit more than one facility so you can compare the cleanliness, office staff helpfulness, cost, promotions, and convenience.\r\n\r\nRenting a self-storage unit is a great solution when you are running out of room in your house to store all your possessions. Your home will have less clutter, rooms will open up and become larger, and at the same time you’ll know that your other household items are being safely stored and can be accessed at any time.\r\n\r\n</div>We recommend that you don’t settle on the first self-storage facility you visit. The facility you select is like an extension of your home. Put together a list of all your requirements. Gather a lot of information by doing on-line research. Then compare multiple facilities, at least 3 or more.\r\n\r\nNow that you have read the self-storage intro and considerations when renting a storage unit, it’s time to start your search.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nIf you want to save money, enjoy a luxurious ride, and get to experience the thrill of going off road, then buying a new SUV might just be a great strategy.\r\n\r\nWhy buy a new SUV in 2020? How is this a great deal? Keep reading and we’ll explore the answers to these questions.\r\n\r\n## Why It Makes Financial and Practical Sense to Buy a New SUV in 2020\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to saving money on cars, you probably don’t think of buying new! Buying second hand can greatly reduce the up-front cost of any vehicle, which in turn can make for a tantalizing option.\r\n\r\nBut here are some things to keep in mind about buying used:\r\n\r\n- You’ll need to replace it sooner\r\n- It won’t retain any value if you try to sell it back or trade it in (a few hundred dollars at best)\r\n- It will be far more likely to experience problems that are expensive to repair\r\n- Parts will be more expensive to source\r\n- Tax will be more expensive\r\n\r\nAnd the list goes on!\r\n\r\nConversely, when you buy a new car, you’ll be able to benefit from a range of great financing options, you’ll pay less tax, and it should last you for years and years. When you eventually do trade it in or sell it off, it will still have retained some of its value!\r\n\r\nAs you’ll see with this list, it’s actually possible to find very affordable SUVs these days, which make buying new a much better deal.\r\n\r\nAs such, it’s more than possible to enjoy a comfortable ride with that wonderful “new smell,” without spending the Earth.\r\n\r\n## Why Choose a SUV\r\n\r\nSo, that’s why you should go new. But why a SUV?\r\n\r\nFor one, a SUV is a fantastic option for families. These cars give you plenty of space to pack in a bunch of kids and all their luggage! Better yet, is that they also protect you and your family thanks to their larger size. They’re highly versatile too: in many cases including fold-down seats and other options. Whether you’re moving home, or going on holiday, these features can be life-savers in a pinch.\r\n\r\nOf course, many families in particular enjoy the fact that they can take their SUVs off-road for a spot of camping. But even if you don’t plan on off-roading, you’ll find that the four-wheel drive is still a wonderful feature to have when it comes to maneuverability and comfort.\r\n\r\nThen there’s the fuel efficiency. SUVs offer fantastic fuel efficiency which makes them excellent for saving money, or for just being a little eco-friendlier.\r\n\r\n## The Best, Most Affordable SUVs for 2020\r\n\r\nSo, you’re convinced and you’re looking for an affordable new SUV for 2020… where to start?\r\n\r\nHere are just some of the most compelling deals available right now:\r\n\r\n**Kia Soul**\r\n\r\nThe Kia Soul will only set you back around $17.5k – that’s before you start haggling! For that amount, you’re getting an awful lot of car<sup>1</sup>. This is a subcompact SUV, but it’s still giving you plenty of storage\r\n\r\n2020 sees a complete redesign for this model, bringing a new engine at the entry level, with 17 more horsepower (for a total of 147) and a bumped-up fuel economy too. You’ll also find some plush new accessories and features here, such as the 7” touchscreen monitor. The only possible downside is that the interior uses some slightly cheaper materials. Still, the seats are comfortable and there is plenty of leg room – which is really the main selling point!\r\n\r\n**Mazda CX-3**\r\n\r\nThe 2020 model is in many ways the same car as the 2019 model, and is a great deal in its own right<sup>2</sup>. The Mazda CX-3 is very affordable, offers a sporty drive, and has a great cabin that is comfortable and fun to drive in.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of features here, such as blind spot monitoring, and the 2L engine is capable of a lot of oomph with 148 horsepower.\r\n\r\nThe red is a particularly great look for this handsome vehicle, and it certainly feels like it should cost more than it does. Still, at $20,640, this is still one of the more expensive options on this list.\r\n\r\nThe 2020 Mazda CX-3 topped many best SUV lists last year and it’s easy to see why<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\n**Nissan Kicks**\r\n\r\nFor prices around $18,870<sup>3</sup>, the Nissan Kicks is a brilliant option. You’ll get a whole lot of trunk space and a lot of features as-standard. For the 2020 model, Nissan brought some great new safety upgrades, which should be a priority for any family. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the car 4 stars in its rollover test. The other safety features include a lane departure warning, rear sensors, blind spot monitoring, and even pedestrian detection!\r\n\r\nIt’s not just about safety though. The car also offers great fuel efficiency (31/36 mpg) and a pretty nice design. You can even get a two-tone color scheme which will help this vehicle to stand out from the crowd (and make it easier to find when parked!).\r\n\r\nThe downside is the relatively smaller engine size at 122 horsepower. Acceleration is a little slow, and the brakes are a slightly soft – which is a shame in an otherwise highly safety-conscious vehicle.\r\n\r\n**2020 Ford EcoSport**\r\n\r\nThe EcoSport has been a very popular vehicle for a while now, as a crossover SUV that is perfect for city-driving, especially for families<sup>4</sup>. The car does have its drawbacks: including a slightly sluggish power-train and relatively low comfort.\r\n\r\nBut with that said, it’s also a very strong choice for anyone looking for a reliable, eco-friendly car that won’t cost the Earth. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the more expensive options on this list owing to that aforementioned success at $20,000+.\r\n\r\n**Honorable Mentions**\r\n\r\n- Hyundai Kona\r\n- Honda HR-V\r\n- Toyota C-HR\r\n\r\n## Closing Comments\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are a surprising number of great SUVs available at very low prices. Any of these will offer you a lot of comfort, safety, and versatility as a daily run-around.

      "content": "\r\nAs evidenced by a recent rental survey<sup>1</sup>, rent prices are plummeting and there’s never been a better time to check prices of new rentals in your area. According to Zumper’s National Rent Report, “demand for rentals in expensive markets is falling while there is increased demand in neighboring, less expensive cities.” While this downturn might be hurting landlord’s pocket books, the silver lining is it might be one of the best times for renters to search for better prices in their area.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1200x620_hero_aerialhomes.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Tenants Are In The Driver’s Seat\r\n\r\nTenants seem to now have an upper hand in snatching up some great deals across major US cities. This is the ripe time to find some affordable, below market rentals since landlords are seeing their vacancies rise. Landlords need to make deals since many employees have lost their job and have vacated their apartments. Many tenants have fled out of town. That flight has pushed down rental prices across major US metropolitan cities.\r\n\r\nAs vacancy rates increase, landlords are forced to lower their rents – it’s the best way for landlords to increase interest in their units. It’s now become a windfall for tenants.\r\n\r\nOnce apartments that were out of reach for some individuals are now prime spots to rent. Apartment dwellers may be able to find a better apartment for the same price as they are paying now or save money.\r\n\r\n## Work From Home Trends\r\n\r\nMany companies have started to adopt a permanent work from home model. Facebook and Twitter announced that employees who are currently working from home can continue to do so on a permanent basis. This may become the new norm for many industries, so it is best for you to be prepared. Millions of workers may flee dense metro areas since they will no longer have to commute. These workers will now find a new geographic freedom.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, a home office is in high demand now. Many businesses are now closed for the foreseeable future or have embraced their employees to work from home from now on. Tenants are now taking this in to consideration now as they do their apartment search.\r\n\r\nAn outdoor space is also becoming very attractive after having to stay indoors for such a long period of time. It is important for the mind and the body. Snatch up that opportunity if it becomes available since it might now be available at a discount.\r\n\r\nThis is a rare time for city dwellers who want to continue to live in the urban lifestyle. As soon as these affordable apartments start to become rented and inventory becomes diminished, you may see a steady increase in rents.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to think about and search for your ideal living situation. You (and your roommate or significant others) may have settled for the size, location, and amenities in your current rental but you don’t have to settle now. Perhaps you have outgrown your current space, but couldn’t afford to move. Maybe you now have a baby and your building doesn’t have a laundry room. Now is your time to act.\r\n\r\n## New Incentives And Offers\r\n\r\nLandlords have also increased their move-in incentives to attract new tenants. In the past, landlords may have offered one month of free rent if you sign a one-year lease. Now landlords are upping their incentives to 2 months<sup>2</sup>. If you amortize a $4,000/month lease over 12 months, you can save an additional $333 per month for that additional free bonus month.\r\n\r\nIf you’re happy where you are living in the city, you can still take advantage of these times. Now Is the time for you to negotiate a new lease. Reports<sup>3</sup> have shown that renters are able to negotiate down their lease 10, 15, or as much as 20% due to so many vacancies.\r\n\r\n## Lifestyle Changes\r\n\r\nIt’s a tenant’s market now and renters are becoming very selective in where they want to live. In the past, a renter may have been lured to a building that offered a pool, gym, and lounge areas. Since theses common areas aren’t open or usable now, these perks have become less enticing and some landlords are pricing their units accordingly.\r\n\r\nMany city renters who wanted to live close to work are now re-evaluating their lifestyle. If they weren’t attached to their city just for work, they are now thinking that if everything is shut down, why should they live there? In the past, there wasn’t a lot of personal or creative time other than to sleep, commute, work, and then repeat those steps every day. Why not have a good quality of life?\r\n\r\n## The Time To Take Action Is Now\r\n\r\nMany brokers are predicting that rental prices in downtown urban areas will continue a downward spiral as demands shift from urban areas to the burbs. Brokers are forecasting this trend throughout the US, from New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Boston, San Jose, Denver, any many other cities.\r\n\r\nSpace and affordability are two things that many metro areas are not known for. However, the time has changed and renters are in the driver’s seat. Now is your opportunity to tap in to the market. Enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. You deserve it. The window for these rental prices might be closing soon, so don’t wait.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nHave you checked the price of gold recently? Well now might be the time to research and find out how to purchase and find the best prices on gold before it keeps on climbing higher. These economic conditions have created a perfect storm for the world’s oldest money to continue increasing in price.\r\n\r\n## A Perfect Storm is Brewing\r\n\r\nThe United States may be in the midst of a perfect storm as the bond yield plunges, the government’s debt surges, and the economic forecast deteriorates. The net effect is a surge in the price in gold that we haven’t seen in eight years. Some analysts are projecting that the price of gold will continue to climb over the next 12 months<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nGold has always been a sought-after metal, not only to make jewelry or as an investment, but it is also used to manufacture some medical devices and electronics. Gold prices didn’t start to fluctuate a lot from its initial $35 per ounce price when Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act back in 1934. But everything changed in 1971 when the US abandoned the gold standard. In 1974, gold prices hit $154 per ounce. What are the drivers that make this highly sought-after precious metal increase in price?\r\n\r\n## Global Bank Reserves\r\n\r\nCentral banks throughout the world hold gold in reserve as well as paper currency. As these banks change their reserves from paper to gold, the price of gold usually rises. It’s interesting to note that many nations’ bank reserves are primarily comprised of only gold<sup>2</sup>!\r\n\r\nGlobal central banks have been buying up the most gold since 1971, according to Bloomberg. Russia has been the leader in this surge. In 2018, central banks bought more gold than any other time since the 70’s<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\n## The Advantages Of Gold\r\n\r\nAs a result of all the uncertainties in paper money, central banks have looked to modify their portfolios. During times of market instability and volatility, banks look to “safe haven” assets that can weather the storm. The perception is that these assets can be safe from losses during a volatile market.\r\n\r\nGold meets the central banks’ objectives during these unstable and unsettled times. The banks’ major goals are return of investment, liquidity, and safety.\r\n\r\nAs an investment, gold has always been known as a “safe haven” asset. During a crisis, gold typically increases in price. There isn’t any credit risk, nor is it associated with any other assets. Therefore, gold is unique in that it can be protected during times of economic uncertainty.\r\n\r\nLiquidity is another of the central banks’ objectives. Gold has high liquidity, so it can be easily traded in global markets.\r\n\r\nOver the long term, gold has delivered a higher return than many other assets. It therefore can enhance central banks’ risk and return portfolio. It’s been known to be a very effective portfolio diversifier since it really doesn’t correlate to other major reserve bank assets.\r\n\r\n## A Delicate Moment For The Economy\r\n\r\nWhy is there a renewed interest in gold? There are two major reasons: an uncertainty about the worldwide market while the world’s political and international relations are intensifying. Secondly, the intrinsic value of gold as an asset of the reserve banks.\r\n\r\nThe renewed trade tensions between US and China and other countries are an unknown. If a truce can’t be reached, the global outcome may worsen. Business investment and supply chains may be disrupted. Global production and productivity may slow down. Some foreign markets have seen a deterioration in business confidence. An example is Germany, since it introduced new automobile fuel emission standards.\r\n\r\n## Industrial Demand For Gold (Not Just Jewelry)\r\n\r\nGold jewelry accounted for about 50% of gold demand back in 2019 or roughly 4,900 tons according to the World Gold Council<sup>2</sup>. The nations who consumed the most amount of gold jewelry are the US, India, and China.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, gold is also used in industry and technology. The industrial and technology sectors account for about 7.5% of gold demand<sup>2</sup>. Gold is a highly efficient conductor of electricity that can carry tiny currents. It is also free of corrosion. Gold is used in GPS, circuit boards, and other precision electronics.\r\n\r\nIt is also used in medical devices, such as stents. Radioactive gold is used to diagnosis some medical conditions. Gold is affected by supply and demand. As the demand for jewelry and technology increases, the price of gold will also rise.\r\n\r\n## Gold Vs. US Dollar Value\r\n\r\nThere is inverse relationship between the price of gold and the value of the US dollar. A strong US dollar usually keeps the gold price low and more in control. As the dollar starts to weaken, gold prices usually increase because the demand increases: more gold can be purchased when the US dollar becomes weakened.\r\n\r\nInflation occurs when consumer prices rise. When the dollar falls, prices increase. So, as inflation starts to climb, so does gold prices. Gold is therefore looked at as being a hedge against inflation.\r\n\r\n## Gold As Investment Protection\r\n\r\nWhen the economy is uncertain or there is a pending recession, individuals will consider investing in gold due to its long-lasting value. As mentioned earlier, gold has always been looked at as being a “safe haven” during uncertain times. As returns on equity, bonds, or real estate fall, investors start to look at investing in gold, which in turn drives up the price. Gold is a hedge against inflation and protects the investor during economic or geo-political turmoil.\r\n\r\n## The Bottom Line\r\n\r\nConsumers, investment companies, and manufactures have long been and will continue to be in love with gold. The drivers of the price of gold include: personal and industrial demand, the value of the dollar, desire to look at gold as a hedge against inflation, and the quantity of gold being held in the central reserve banks.\r\n\r\nTake the first step now and explore how you can preserve your purchasing power, protect your assets, and diversify your portfolio – check prices and the best ways to buy gold online.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nSuffering with diabetes is no joke. You feel constantly low on energy and can never eat the things you want to eat. Not only that but you’re at constant risk of multiple health complications including impaired eyesight, heart problems and even amputations. It’s a serious nightmare and anyone who has experienced it will know just how much it can interfere with your life. That’s why it’s so important to get on top of this condition as soon as you can, and to fight back. If you do that, you can still enjoy a great quality of life and even reverse some of the damage.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Diabetes.jpg)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for diabetes. Once you’ve been diagnosed, this is a lifelong condition. Diabetes treatments are centered around managing the symptoms then, but if you get this right, you can take better control of your life.\r\n\r\n## Restoring Insulin Sensitivity\r\n\r\nSo anyone who has been diagnosed with diabetes will know that the problem is to do with their insulin production or sensitivity, which results in increased blood sugar and low energy. Insulin is the hormone that signals to the body to absorb sugar in order for it to be used to produce energy. When insulin stops working, that results in a build up of sugar in the blood that can harm nerves, cause inflammation, and generally wreak havoc. Meanwhile, the lack of usable energy leaves the individual feeling lethargic and tired.\r\n\r\nThe more common form of diabetes is Type 2, where the insulin becomes less effective at stimulating the body to absorb sugar. Fortunately, there are methods for improving insulin sensitivity that can help a great deal.\r\n\r\n## Supplements and Lifestyle\r\n\r\nOne example of a supplement that can enhance insulin sensitivity is cinnamon. Cinnamon has been shown in many studies to help lower cholesterol and blood sugar. Some researchers even suggest it could even be a possible _curative_ treatment for diabetes with further investigation. In one particular study, volunteers were given 1-6 grams of cinnamon for 40 days and were able to cut their blood sugar levels by as much as 24%<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nAnother example of a potential supplement is milk thistle. This has an active component known as ‘silymarin’ which has been shown to help support liver health and to strengthen the liver. It has been shown in some studies to be effective at lowering insulin resistance even in diabetic patients!\r\n\r\n## Exercise\r\n\r\nAlso useful is exercise. Exercise increases the demand for immediate energy in the body and this forces our systems to plunder fat stores as well as the blood for glucose. When you exercise intensively, this can help you to immediately use up large quantities of sugar and thereby it works in a similar way to starving your body of energy.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to quickly benefit from the diabetes-fighting benefits of diabetes is by using Tabata – a form of High Intensity Interval Training (“HIIT”) exercise. This takes just four minutes!\r\n\r\nIn case that sounds like gobbledygook, HIIT is a form of exercise that encourages bouts of sprinting or otherwise all-out exertion, punctuated with periods of relative calm and ‘active recovery’.\r\n\r\nWhen combined, these two strategies drain the sugar from your blood _super fast_ and burn away dangerous fat around the abdomen. This works so well, because the high intensity exercise (anaerobic) will actually deplete all the sugar in your blood, thus forcing the body to rely on other means for continued exertion during the active rest phases. This is perfect for increasing the energy efficiency of the body, especially in diabetic patients.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, HIIT has been shown to increase the efficiency of your mitochondria, meaning your body gets more benefit from less exercise. Mitochondria are the energy factories of the cells that are responsible for converting glucose into ATP.\r\n\r\nTo perform Tabata you’re basically going to pick a form of CV exercise and perform it 8 times – training intensely for 20 seconds then taking a break for 10 seconds (set a recurring timer on your phone).\r\n\r\nIn 4 minutes you’ll have had an incredible workout and in time you’ll find your energy is tons better – not to mention your health!\r\n\r\n## Diet\r\n\r\nYou can also enhance this effect even further by combining the right types of exercise with the right types of diet. For instance, if you use ‘fasted cardio’ that means that you’ll be exercising specifically when you have low levels of blood sugar already. If you do this, then you’ll be forcing your body to work even harder at getting the energy from your body.\r\n\r\nNote as well that insulin isn’t _only_ used for energy – it is also an anabolic hormone that the body uses for getting nutrients out the blood to build muscle and tissue. When you work out you can increase levels of testosterone and growth hormone and this will help to enhance the role of insulin in your system.\r\n\r\nOf course, the most important dietary rule for diabetics and pre-diabetics is to avoid consuming too much sugar. You can make it easier for your body to control levels of sugar by keeping levels low. Eat just enough for energy, and aim to consume complex carbs rather than simple carbs wherever possible. That means your energy should be coming from sweet potatoes and whole-grain bread NOT from cake and sweets. This will release sugar more slowly into your system, providing a steady flow rather than a sudden spike. Guess which is easier for your body to cope with?\r\n\r\nIf you want to go even further, you can try adopting a fully ketogenic diet<sup>3</sup>. The ketogenic diet involves completely eradicating sugar from the diet, which in turn forces the body to rely on alternative energy sources _other_ than glucose. After around 48 hours, this puts the body in a ketogenic state where it switches to fat as a primary fuel source. This can be extremely effective for diabetic patients, but is a huge commitment that won’t suit everyone. It’s certainly something to investigate further.\r\n\r\n## Supplements That Raise Energy\r\n\r\nBut here’s the thing: insulin is only one part of the equation. There were ways you could become more efficient at using the energy you _do_ have right now, and these can also help with diabetes management.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this is with creatine. Creatine is a bodybuilding supplement that enables the body to recycle ATP. This is adenosine triphosphate, the energy ‘currency’ that glucose is eventually converted into. The result? You get a little more energy from the ATP that makes it to your cells. Even if you have diabetes _some_ is getting through and this way that little bit goes further.\r\n\r\nThis an effective and lesser-known supplement for diabetes sufferers and can have an _immediate_ impact on energy levels.\r\n\r\nHere’s the next one: coQ10 AKA coenzyme Q10. This is another supplement that improves the energy efficiency of your cells by boosting mitochondrial function.\r\n\r\nYou use these and then you can exercise more, which results in even more benefits.\r\n\r\nOmega 3 is also effective against diabetes. By allowing energy to pass into the cells more easily in the form of glucose and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), Omega 3 helps to make the body more energy efficient. This again means that you get more of a boost from less sugar.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, omega 3 also combats joint pain and depression which makes it easier to stay active – yet another benefit for diabetics.\r\n\r\n## Closing Thoughts\r\n\r\nAs you can see then, although there are no cures for diabetes, there are ways to improve your energy levels and to manage insulin resistance. These things can help you to live a healthy and normal life. In fact, many diabetic individuals find that the combination of low insulin and lots of exercise ensures they actually look particularly ripped and muscular!\r\n\r\nOf course, none of this is a substitute for regular insulin injections. Follow the instructions of your physician. Diabetes is not to be trifled with, but nor is it something that needs to bring your life to a grinding halt.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nToday’s breakthroughs in dental implant technology have driven down the cost to manufacture and made them stronger than ever. 15 years ago, just the parts could cost your dentist over $1000 per tooth – today that same implant is stronger, lasts longer, can be computer modeled to match your exact shade and color and cost the dentist only $150<sup>1</sup>\r\n\r\nIn the early 2000s, the implants your dentist would purchase could cost $600 for the implant, $300 for stock abutments, and $50 for a healing abutment. The implant manufacturers would even charge $50 for a single screw cover. $50 sounds crazy for the cost of a single screw.\r\n\r\nThen at the same time, dentists don’t work for free and have to make money on the procedure so they could have charged a patient close to $2500 per tooth! How’s it possible for anyone to afford that? The average human mouth has 32 teeth so can you imagine it would cost over $80,000 to get your whole mouth done?\r\n\r\nIt makes sense dental implants were not a popular choice 20 years ago. Dentists were just not in a good place in 2001 – they wanted to help their patients but the cost of the actual implants were so high and they need to make money on the procedure so it just wasn’t affordable for most people. Unless you were wealthy and willing to shell out $80,000 for a full set of dental implants, you’d be out of luck.\r\n\r\n### \\***\\*Driving Down Costs\\*\\***\r\n\r\nIn 2004, a dentist by the name of Dr. Niznick began working on a new dental implant company, where he would make high-quality products, including clones of many products from the big companies, but at a fraction of the cost. The “Zimmer system” dentists refer to today was originally developed Dr. Niznick as the screw-vent internal hex implant.\r\n\r\nHe launched his company in 2006 and it changed the industry by offering the complete implants to dentists for $100 – the implant, stock abutment, impression analog, and cover screw<sup>1</sup>. And as classic economic theory on pricing would dictate, other implant manufacturer’s sales began struggling at higher prices and naturally the higher-priced manufactures were forced to lower their prices as well.\r\n\r\nSo who benefits the most from the disruption? The dentists and the patients. Dentists could finally lower the implant prices and increase the number of implant procedures they did all at the same time. The dentists could still make a profit and help their patients achieve a perfect smile for less.\r\n\r\nDentists today can now buy implants from the manufacturer in the $180–$240 range with a different variety of components. There are new manufacturers based out of Israel that are trying to push that cost down even more to $150 for the dentist so that they can pass that savings onto their patients<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n### **\\*\\***New Breakthroughs In Dental Implant Technology**\\*\\***\r\n\r\nIn addition to lowering costs of the implants themselves, there have been huge advancements in computer designed implants in recent years. Let’s dive into how computer designed implants can help you replace missing or failing teeth.\r\n\r\nWhile the ultimate goal of dental implants is to achieve bone stability, bone loss is an unavoidable effect of the procedure. However, with advancements in computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM), doctors can take a scan of your mouth to create a perfect replacement based on your actual mouth and teeth. This helps create a exact duplicate of the missing teeth and reduces bone loss overall. The best part of this technology is that it offers patients reduced post procedure symptoms and speeds up healing time<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThe dentist will first take a 3D image of your mouth and identify the missing or failing teeth that need to be replaced. Because of the advancements in 3D printing, doctors are now able to model the exact size, shape and dimensions and “print” an exact match for your mouth. This offers a simple and effective solution for artificial tooth replacement which reduces the number of visits and painful procedures. That’s why it makes sense that everyone is getting dental implants these days – the industry is supposed to grow to over $8.3 billion by 2025<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\n### Antibacterial Coatings\r\n\r\nWhile still not widely available yet, another area where there have been advancements in dental implant technology is the coating materials themselves. There are new antibacterial coatings currently being developed that increase the longevity of the implants.\r\n\r\nMany foods that contain high acid content have the potential to cause dental enamel erosion but there are also new coatings that can give patients more freedom to eat and drink what they want without being concerned about damaging their implants<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\n### Better Fit, Stronger, and Cheaper!\r\n\r\n</div>Today’s implants aren’t your grandparents’ kind! Forget the “false teeth” look that patients once had to live with. Today, dentists use computerized images to create a look that is just right for your face and that fit perfectly in your mouth. As technology evolves, implant manufacturers, dental labs, and dentists are all able to pass savings onto patients making care more affordable and improving patient’s lives.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nMedical billing and coding is a qualification that many people won’t have heard of or considered when thinking about their career options. However, this could be an oversight, given that medical billing is actually a lucrative, enjoyable, and relatively straight-forward role that can appeal to many candidates. Below you’ll find links to some excellent coding degrees, so check them out!\r\n\r\nA medical coder is someone who takes a doctor’s notes and then enters them into a huge database. If you have never considered this job role before, then it may not have occurred to you that all that information needs to be logged!\r\n\r\n![](/posts/woman-medical-assistant-physician-skin-Pharmacy-technician-service-1605139-pxhere.com-1.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the US, categorizing and logging patient data is extremely important for insurance purposes. This way, the correct bill can be provided in order to cover the cost of treatment – this is medical billing. Coding meanwhile ensures that a patient’s personal medical history is kept accurate and up-to-date. For instance, a physician might not that a particular patient exhibited signs of an allergic reaction to penicillin. By ensuring that this information is correctly logged, future doctors treating the same patient can avoid making the same mistake. Such information can be life-saving.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, logging this data is important for statistic reasons. This allows governments to keep track of national and local statistics. That can in turn allow them to identify potential outbreaks and epidemics more quickly, as well as knowing where to invest resources in order to ensure better health outcomes.\r\n\r\nThere are specialty certifications that can help prepare coders for specific roles. These include:\r\n\r\n- Certified professional coder\r\n- Certified outpatient coder\r\n- Certified risk adjustment coder\r\n- And certified inpatient coder\r\n\r\n## Who Should Become a Coder?\r\n\r\nMedical billing and coding is a challenging and rewarding job that requires a good understanding of human biology and medicine, as well as an organized and analytic mind. Medical coders will use International Classification of Diseases (ICD)<sup>1</sup> codes in order to ensure that the doctors and nurses are making standardized notes on treatments and diagnoses. Candidates should be happy working independently and comfortable using large data sets.\r\n\r\nYou do not strictly require a bachelor’s degree in order to become a medical coder. It is possible to land a job with an associate degree or post-secondary certificate, though a bachelor’s qualification will help you to land supervisory roles and will set you apart from the competition.\r\n\r\nThis is a job role that is growing in demand. Due to a growing use of electronic records, as well as the aging population, the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts demand will increase by 11% from 2018 to 2028, resulting in 23,100 new jobs.\r\n\r\nThe average salary for a medical coder is $40,350<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nOver half of all medical billing and coding specialists work in hospitals and physician’s offices. Other potential employers include insurance companies, nursing care facilities, government agencies, and research organizations.\r\n\r\n## What to Expect\r\n\r\nWhen completing a medical billing and coding program, you will be expected to learn the fundamentals of human anatomy and physiology, as well as pathopharmacology. This will provide a basic grounding in medicine and biology, which can also be attractive to employers in a range of other industries. You could find it easier to land a job as a dental assistant for example, or to get onto another medical course.\r\n\r\nYou will also be expected to learn and recite numerous codes that are used as shorthand to refer to specific conditions. A good memory and the ability to quickly retrieve information is therefore advised.\r\n\r\nDepending on the level of the qualification, the time taking to complete the course will vary. An associate degree program is two years, whereas a bachelor’s is four years.\r\n\r\nUnlike a nursing degree, medical coding does not require a large amount of practical coursework or hands-on experience. This means that the course can be taught almost entirely online, potentially saving the student a lot of time and money, while giving them the flexibility to choose the working style that suits them best.\r\n\r\nBecoming a medical billing and coding expert is a great option for anyone interested in human biology, and anyone who wants to help others. If you are systematically minded, if you are happy working on your own, and if you are willing to pursue a degree, then this might be a great choice.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge? Learning to read the infamously bad handwriting of doctors without going mad!\r\n\r\n1. [com](https://www.idc.com/)\r\n2.

      "content": "\r\nWith interest rates at a true low point, NOW is the time to consider consolidating your debt or refinancing your home. This article will provide you with an understanding of these solutions, why now, and how they can save you a lot of money in the long term.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Re-fi-house.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Why NOW is the Time to Refinance\r\n\r\nMany of us rely on loans to live the lifestyles that we want. Even the most loan-free individuals among us will likely be paying back a home loan and/or an auto loan. These are recurring payments that come out of our accounts each month (or quarter) and while they might not seem like huge amounts individually, they certainly add up over time.\r\n\r\nWhen we take out any loan, we will be at the mercy of the interest rates offered to us. These are based on many factors, including our personal credit scores, inflation, levels of economic growth, and the Federal Reserve Monetary Policy<sup>1</sup>. The higher the interest rate, the more we will need to pay back. This is often written as APR (annual percentage rate)<sup>2</sup>, which refers to the percentage of the total loan we repay each month.\r\n\r\nThis is true for both home loans and for personal loans. Even credit card rates and overdraft terms will change in response to your circumstances and the fluctuating market. Thus, if you take out a loan of any kind when interest rates are high, you will be charged more than if you take them out when rates are lower.\r\n\r\nThat’s why it’s important to be on the look-out for opportunities to switch. The good news is that we are not “stuck” with any one loan, and the option is always there to jump ship. Two options include debt consolidation, and home refinancing. And it’s times like _right now_ that these can prove to be excellent options.\r\n\r\n## Debt Consolidation\r\n\r\nDebt consolidation describes the act of taking out a single loan in order to pay off multiple others. For example, if you had a mortgage, a credit card loan and another bank loan that you used to buy a bike for example, you could then consolidate all of these debts by taking out one larger loan that would pay off all those three loans. This can be done “manually” – as in handled on your own (i.e. you take out the loan and pay off the debts with it then concentrate on paying off the final loan) or using a debt consolidation service or company who can also help advise you, discuss options and negotiate terms and potentially even reduce some of your other debts. Often debts are consolidated into a single home loan.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons to consolidate your debts into a single loan. The most obvious reason is to benefit from lower interest rates or a fixed interest rate. For example, if you have one or several loans with a particularly high interest rate, you can pay them off with a single loan that has a lower interest rate and thereby decrease the overall amount you will be paying. Again, this is why it’s such a good idea to consider this strategy _now_ while rates are at their lowest.\r\n\r\nIt’s even possible to get loans at zero percent APR in some cases, helping you to save a _lot_ of money on your interest. Of course, you are unlikely to get home financing with 0% APR!\r\n\r\n**More Advantages of Debt Consolidation**\r\n\r\nJust the fact that you have interest on a single loan rather than multiple loans can also make interest much easier to calculate and to plan for, and can make the loans themselves much easier to pay. If you have about five loan repayments coming out of your current account it can be highly stressful and very complicated, whereas having just one on a regular basis can make it easy to plan for and pay.\r\n\r\nUsing a service to consolidate your loans can also often make the loan repayment more flexible to suit you – you can pay it off more quickly in several larger lump sums, or can drag it out over time. You should also be able to set the day that the repayment comes out to help fit it around your other financial commitments. In these ways loan consolidation is sensible from a practical stand point as well as a financial one.\r\n\r\n**Secured vs Unsecured Loans**\r\n\r\nSometimes this loan is simply another loan much like your others (this is called an “unsecured” loan), however in most cases the loan is taken out against an asset of the borrower as collateral. Most commonly this asset is the borrower’s home and the mortgage is secured against the house.\r\n\r\nHere, by using the mortgage as collateral, the interest rate is able to be lower than it would otherwise. Thus consolidation of debt into a home loan is able to save you even more money. The down side of course is that the borrower agrees the foreclosure of their asset (in this case the home) to pay back the loan. However, for those who are not in a desperate situation and can afford to pay back their new loan comfortably, this is a sensible way to save money and unnecessary stress. In a similar vein mortgages can also be increased, or you can take out entirely new mortgages, to pay for extra work around a house or other expenses rather than paying for various separate jobs individually. This is similar in theory but requires more forward planning. This two could be considered a type of debt consolidation using a home loan, except using the reverse process to that outlined above.\r\n\r\n## Home Refinancing\r\n\r\nBy including your home loan in your debt consolidation, you’ll also be refinancing your property. This is a great option, seeing as your home loan is very likely to be the highest-interest and largest loan that you are paying back each month<sup>4</sup>.\r\n\r\nOf course, you may decide that debt consolidation is not for you, and that you don’t have enough ongoing loans that require consolidating. In that case, you might opt simply to refinance your home loan. This then means that you’ll be taking out a new loan to replace your current one. This can not only reduce the interest rate if you time it correctly, but also help to cut monthly payments and even allow you to withdraw some equity to gain a cash injection!\r\n\r\nRemember when refinancing your home loan, you will have the opportunity to reduce the total amount that you are repaying. You might be tempted to reduce your monthly costs and thereby enjoy a greater cash flow, but you might also alternatively choose to keep repayments consistent and simply shorten the amount of time you’re repaying that loan. This way, you could be mortgage-free five years earlier simply by switching while interest rates are down!\r\n\r\nLikewise, don’t make the assumption that becoming mortgage-free quickly is necessarily the end goal for everyone. There is no right or wrong answer here, just the opportunity to readjust your finances to better suit your lifestyle and goals.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nLooking to upgrade your personal transport? In this post, you’ll discover some of the best new cars available in 2020, and how to drive them for less!\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to saving money on automobiles, many of us instantly assume that the best strategy will be to find a second-hand vehicle. Cars lose their value the moment they are driven out of the showroom, which means you can often get a great deal even if the car has done barely any miles! Most people are therefore _not_ looking for a new car when they’re trying to save cash.\r\n\r\nBut this isn’t always the best strategy. In fact, buying new comes with a number of great advantages.\r\n\r\nFor one, buying new means that you will be able to hang onto the vehicle much longer. A new car should last you a good 4-8 years, meaning that it will be a long time before you need to think about upgrading. Spread the cost of your vehicle over that time, and you’ll realize it’s not such a bad deal!\r\n\r\nThere are other incentives too. For one, a new car will hold its value more than an old car, meaning that you’ll get more money back when you trade it in. Then there’s the fact that new cars tend to have fewer faults and problems. It’s not unusual to spend $1,000 on a second-hand car, only to then spend another $700 on repairs over the next year.\r\n\r\nNew cars are also more fuel efficient, cheaper to tax, and generally less hassle. You’ll also find more deals and financing options for new vehicles, helping you to spread the cost and pay less up-front. They might still be more expensive on the whole than going second hand, but once you take all of this into account, the difference probably isn’t as drastic as you may have thought!\r\n\r\nAnd as a reward for spending that little bit more, you get to drive around in something that looks amazing and makes you feel like a boss. Here are just some of the best new cars of 2020 that you can get for an affordable price, but that will still prove reliable, luxurious, and great to drive.\r\n\r\n## Best New Cars of 2020\r\n\r\n**2020 Kia Forte FE**\r\n\r\nThis car will only cost you $17,890<sup>1</sup>, and comes with a bunch of amazing features you’d expect to see on a much more expensive vehicle. For example, how does an 8” screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto sound?\r\n\r\nThe base model has a 147-hp engine, six speed manual transmission, and great fuel efficiency at 31/41 mpg. That’s actually the best EPA rated fuel economy of any Forte thus far.\r\n\r\nThe car looks nice too, even if it is a little no-frills. It has a friendly, rounded appearance, a relatively low profile, and a small footprint that’s ideal for tucking into parking spots.\r\n\r\n**2020 Toyota Yaris**\r\n\r\nAt around $17,550 for the 2020 release, this car is an absolute steal<sup>2</sup>. The Yaris comes as either a sedan or a hatchback, and either way is essentially identical to a Mazda – but with the addition of Toyota grilles.\r\n\r\nOr you could get the 2019 Yaris, which is still a great car today with lots of great features. The emergency breaking for example is something that any family will be particularly pleased to find here.\r\n\r\nWe’re also big fans of the design generally, and the interior is very comfortable. If you want a car that is affordable, very reasonably priced, and has no glaring flaws – then the Toyota Yaris is that car!\r\n\r\n**2020 Hyundai Accent**\r\n\r\nAt around $16,000 for the base model<sup>3</sup>, this is the cheapest car on this list yet. The Accent SE has a five-year warranty (up to 60,000 miles), which means that your money will go a long way too.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, is that the Accent comes with a number of great luxury features that once again, belie the price. One particularly nice inclusion, is the remote keyless entry, which saves time and can be very useful when you have your hands full of shopping. You also get power door locks, and you can go automatic for just $1,000 more.\r\n\r\nThe fuel economy is good too, at 33/41 mpg. This is a marked improvement over the 2019 model. And once again, this is a great looking sedan that sits low to the ground and has a very modern design sensibility. The ride is smooth, the engine is quiet, and overall it’s an absolute bargain!\r\n\r\n**2020 Kia Rio**\r\n\r\nRounding out our list is the 2020 Kia Rio. The 2019 model was a fantastic car, and 2020 brings a number of impressive upgrades<sup>4</sup>. The engine is a little small at 120 hp, but in return you’ll be getting automatic as standard and a new CVT.\r\n\r\nIt also boasts amazing fuel economy, and the same Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility – all for just $16,675.\r\n\r\nThe car looks the part too, especially in silver which is sleek and modern.\r\n\r\n## How to Get New Cars for Less\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to get new cars for less, then there are a few things you can consider doing.\r\n\r\nThe first, is to choose the car wisely. As mentioned, there are more factors that go into the overall cost of your vehicle than just the up-front price. Things like fuel-economy and insurance will impact the total you pay over the lifetime of the vehicle, so do some quick math when making your decision.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you should think carefully when deciding on financing options. A car loan can make a big difference to your available cash flow, but it often comes at a cost. Don’t buy into a deal with a high APR before considering purchasing on your credit card or using other strategies.\r\n\r\nThat said, if the dealer may also be willing to buy your old vehicle in order to reduce the overall cost of your vehicle. This can often get you a better deal than if you were to sell the car independently – because of course the seller wants your business!\r\n\r\nLikewise, while these are great new cars, you can often make a big saving by looking for the 2019 or 2018 models. These will have lost some value by becoming the “older model,” but they’ll still run just as well as they did before. Whatever you buy, it will be old-hat come next year anyway!\r\n\r\nFinally, make sure to haggle a little. It’s normal to negotiate when buying a new car, so be ready to walk away if the salesperson can’t provide you some incentive.\r\n\r\n## Closing Comments\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the best new cars available for 2020 and some of the ways you can get them for even less. Take these tips into account, and you may just be driving a shiny, new car very soon – without breaking the bank!\r\n\r\n1. [Kia Forte](https://www.kia.com/us/en/forte)\r\n2.

      "content": "\r\nPsoriasis is an annoying condition that is associated with dry and flaky skin. This can be painful in some rare cases, but is primarily a frustrating and aesthetic issue for many people. A psoriasis “flare up” can be highly embarrassing, covering the face, arms, and torso with flaky patches of red skin. Sufferers struggle to find the best treatments. The good news is that it CAN be treated, and if you know how to approach psoriasis management, you can enjoy healthy, smooth skin once again. Tired of your treatment, then read on and discover some of the latest advancements.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Psoriasis.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that psoriasis is a more complex issue that it might initially seem. This is an autoimmune disease for starters, rather than an issue related to dry or oily skin. It is actually caused by an increased rate of production of the skin cells, and can be triggered by wound repair. In most people, skin cells are replaced at around 28-30 days. In psoriasis however, this process ramps all the way up to every 3-5 days<sup>1</sup>!\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are some ways to address this specific problem.\r\n\r\n## Top Treatments for Psoriasis\r\n\r\n**Vitamin D Supplementation**\r\n\r\nVitamin D and its analogs are particularly effective at treating autoimmune diseases like psoriasis. This is because vitamin D has the potential to be even more effective for the immune system than vitamin C<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nVitamin D actually has less in common with other vitamins and acts more like a master hormone, helping to regulate the production of other hormones throughout the body. This allows it to support immunity and keep the body healthy and strong. Seeing as outbreaks of psoriasis often tend to occur during times when our immunity is suppressed (during a cold or period of stress for example), this can help to prevent that from happening.\r\n\r\nVitamin D production occurs in the body but requires the presence of direct sunlight exposure. Spending more time outdoors is a great way to combat psoriasis then, especially seeing as fresh air can also help to improve the immune system.\r\n\r\n**Corticosteroids**\r\n\r\nIf you had an immune reaction that was causing unwanted swelling, then you may be treated with a corticosteroid to help ease the symptoms. For example, if you suffered from tendinitis, then a doctor may use an injection of corticosteroids to treat that.\r\n\r\nSeeing as psoriasis is often caused by similar actions in the immune response, corticosteroids can be similarly effective in combating it. Corticosteroids are most effective at treating psoriasis when they are described as “very strong.” By combining this approach with vitamin D supplementation, many patients enjoy a very positive outcome.\r\n\r\n**Mineral Oils**\r\n\r\nOne of the more unpleasant effects of psoriasis is that the skin can form into what are known as plaques. These are hard patches of skin that are particularly unappealing and can even be uncomfortable. Applying mineral oils directly to the area can help to minimize this effect. Moisturizers are also effective, withering petroleum jelly, calcipotriol, and decubal. Emollients are particularly effective when combined with phototherapy.\r\n\r\n**Phototherapy**\r\n\r\nWhich brings us nicely to this option. Phototherapy works by using light waves that are designed to mimic the sun. This triggers the release of vitamin D, while also penetrating through the outer layers of the skin. The wavelengths used specifically are 311-313 nanometers… so now you know!\r\n\r\n**Anti-Inflammatory Foods**\r\n\r\nInflammation in the body is responsible for all kinds of unwanted effects, potentially even including depression (due to inflammation affecting the brain). Psoriasis is one more thing that can be caused by inflammation, as it causes the skin cells to become damaged and rushes blood to the area. Remember: inflammation is an immune response!\r\n\r\nTo help combat this, some of the most effective treatments include:\r\n\r\n- Diets high in omega 3. Omega 3 exists in balance with omega 6 and while both essential fatty acids are important, when the balance becomes skewed, this leads to inflammation. Many of us have too much omega 6 in our diets, and not enough omega 3 – so consuming more oily fish can help a lot.\r\n- Turmeric is a remedy that is not only anti-inflammatory but also helps to alter gene expression<sup>3</sup>. This is interesting, as it can affect the gene expressions responsible for flare ups!\r\n- Vanilla extract\r\n\r\n## How Stress Contributes to Psoriasis and What to Do About It\r\n\r\nStress can impact on your complexion in a variety of different ways.\r\n\r\nFor starters, stress increases the heart rate due to an influx of adrenaline. This in turn means that your blood will be circulated more rapidly and forcefully which can lead to a short term reddening of the complexion as well as a blotchiness.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, stress also suppresses the immune system. This is why something like psoriasis is much more likely to ‘flare up’ when you are experiencing acute stress. Essentially, the body believes you are under attack from an external threat which is why blood is driven to the brain and the muscles. This unfortunately has the unwanted side effect of leaving your immune system ‘wide open’ to attack.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly bad for those with psoriasis in fact because psoriasis is considered to be a diseases of the immune system. Specifically, psoriasis is thought to be caused by chemical messengers called neuropeptides. These cause pain, itching and inflammation and are a part of the normal immune response but can be overactive in psoriasis. Anything that causes upset to your immune system then appears to be more likely to lead to this activity and the breakouts.\r\n\r\nStress also affects hormones and as is well known, hormones are very much responsible for the sebum secreted from the skin. The more stressed you are, the more out of whack those hormones will be.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the fact that stress causes you to lose sleep, eat less healthily and touch your face more regularly (many of us do this unconsciously when we’re nervous) and you have something of a ‘perfect storm’ when it comes to bad skin.\r\n\r\n**What to do About Stress and Acne**\r\n\r\nSo if you’re experiencing acne or psoriasis and you think it’s at least partly to do with stress, what can you do?\r\n\r\nOne option is to try and address and eliminate the ‘stressors’ in your life. These are anything that present an ongoing or immediate source of stress and can include things like work stress or financial pressure. You may want to consider changing jobs, getting debt management or at least just taking a holiday to unwind.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more effective still though is to focus on the way you deal with stress. Stress isn’t really caused by events or circumstances so much as it is caused by our _reaction_ to those events and circumstances. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a form of psychotherapeutic intervention that focuses on teaching you how to change the way you think about stressful situations and how to cope with stressful events. This can give you the skills and the tools you need to remain calmer – and when you can do that your body and your skin will thank you!\r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\n\r\nPsoriasis is a complex condition and one that responds best to an assault on multiple fronts. Focus not only on the skin itself, but also on your immunity, and even your mood. If you do this correctly, you can manage flare ups and even keep them at bay.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nIf you’re looking for a way to get out of debt and to gain financial independence, then a reverse mortgage might be for you. What’s more, is that a reverse mortgage can help you to gain more disposable income, and to free up your assets. The catch? It’s usually only available to seniors. If that includes you though… then you’re good to go!\r\n\r\nSo what precisely is a reverse mortgage? Essentially, this is a loan that is available to a homeowner that is over 62 years of age<sup>1</sup>. As the name implies, this works a little like a home loan in reverse. Because the homeowner will have equity in their property, they will be able to borrow against that value in exchange for a lump sum.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Reverse-mortgage.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhat makes a reverse mortgage unique though, is that you won’t need to make loan repayments. Instead, the entire loan balance becomes due all at once – at the moment that the borrower either dies, moves out of their current home, or sells their property. At this point, the lender seizes the property and thereby pays off the outstanding debt.\r\n\r\nThis might seem like black magic: essentially it means you are receiving regular income, while nothing about your current circumstances will change! From the perspective of the bank, they are essentially paying for your home in installments.\r\n\r\n## The Details\r\n\r\nWhen you receive a reverse mortgage, you of course need to ensure that the total amount of the loan will never exceed the value of the property. This of course ensures that there will not be any outstanding amount once the total amount is due and the property is sold.\r\n\r\nWhat’s also particularly important is that the borrower/borrower’s estate won’t be responsible for paying any difference if the loan _should_ become larger than the value of the property. This is important too, as outside factors can sometimes impact on the price of a home: such as a natural disaster. This way, it will be the lender that will take on the risk.\r\n\r\n## Pros and Cons\r\n\r\nOne of the big advantages of a reverse mortgage is that the recipient won’t need to make any changes to their current lifestyle, but will receive a steady new income to help them enjoy a more comfortable style of living. This can be particularly useful if the individual does not have an extensive retirement plan, for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nPerhaps best of all, is that the borrower still maintains the title on their home. The property ownership is not being transferred to the bank, but rather the home is being used as collateral. The difference is that the agreement is that this collateral _will_ be collected on at some point. Reverse mortgages are also federally insured.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are some important caveats to consider. For example, it’s worth noting that this is still a loan, which means there is still interest. Interest means that you will pay back more than the total of what you borrow, which means you will be losing money on the value of your home.\r\n\r\nHowever, the borrower does not need to pay anything up front as that interest in included in the monthly costs. What’s more, is that the loan will usually involve relatively low amounts of interest, seeing as this is a particularly safe and secure option for the banks. Because they are almost guaranteed to receive the property at the end of the agreement, there is a very low likelihood of anything happening to their investment. Thus they are able to offer a lower rate.\r\n\r\n## Heirs and Family\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest downside of using a reverse mortgage, is that it leaves less of an estate for surviving heirs and family members. In other words, if you were to pass away without a loan of this nature, you would normally leave your property to your children or grandchildren to benefit from. They will likely then sell the property in many cases to liquidize the assets, or they might even choose to keep the property and move into it! Either way, you deny your surviving family that option by using a reverse mortgage.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are some caveats to this point to keep in mind. Firstly, any value greater than the loan that is obtained through the sale of the property will still go to your heirs. Depending on your age and how much you are borrowing, this might still be a good amount!\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is that there is never any guarantee that you’ll be able to pass on the value of your property anyway. While it’s not nice to think about, many people over 85 find that as they get older, they require care and assistance. The cost of full-time care can be extremely high, and this can result in the loss of property and assets.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, you will end up spending all of your equity and savings to afford this care, ultimately leaving nothing behind.\r\n\r\nThis is not especially common, and you shouldn’t assume it will be the case. But what you do need to be aware of, is simply that there are no guarantees. So why not enjoy the money you earned while you can? What’s more, is that there is no reason you can’t give some of the money you receive from your reverse mortgage to your kids and grandchildren. Why not let them enjoy it now while you know it’s there, and while you can witness them putting it to good use?\r\n\r\n## Types of Reverse Mortgage\r\n\r\nFinally, there are different types of reverse mortgage, and many options for repayments.\r\n\r\nThe three types of reverse mortgage are<sup>2</sup>:\r\n\r\n- HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage)\r\n- Proprietary Reverse Mortgage\r\n- Single-Purpose Reverse Mortgage\r\n\r\nThe most common type, and the type we have discussed here, is the HECM. This can then provide payments in a range of different manners:\r\n\r\n- Lump sum\r\n- Equal monthly payments (annuity)\r\n- Term payments\r\n- Line of credit\r\n- Equal monthly payments plus a line of credit\r\n\r\nWhen choosing a reverse mortgage, it is your job to decide which option suits you best and will result in the best rates over the long term.\r\n\r\nWhatever you decide, this is a great way to regain some cash flow and to really enjoy your retirement!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nPharmacy technician is a crucially important role that helps the local community using specialist medical knowledge and excellent communication and administrative skills. For those interested in helping others, earning a healthy salary in a job that isn’t going anywhere, and learning about human biology, this is a great fit.\r\n\r\nLet’s explore this high demand job, training required, salary and lifestyle.\r\n\r\n## What is a Pharmacy Technician?\r\n\r\nThose interested in the medical field will very often focus their efforts on becoming doctors, nurses, or perhaps dental assistants. In reality though, there are many other important jobs that will put an understanding of human biology to good use. A pharmacy technician is just one such role.\r\n\r\nA pharmacy technician is someone who works in a pharmacy and is responsible for handing out prescriptions. This means they are also required to organize and manage large amounts of inventory, to measure and mix medications, to take notes, and even to provide medical advice in some cases. Depending on the company you work for, you might also be required to offer additional services – even providing basic medical checks!\r\n\r\n## Training\r\n\r\nBecoming a pharmacy technician does not require a degree, however you will need to be registered with the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB) in the US<sup>1</sup>. This in turn will require training – it is required that you either hold a diploma or a GED.\r\n\r\nAnother route is to seek certification via the National Healthcareer Association (NHA). The NHA also offers certification, and requires applicants to have at least a year of experience working as a technician, and to hold at least a high school diploma.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing courses and diplomas, it is important to look for those that offer an internship. This means that you’ll be placed within a pharmacy in order to experience what it is like to work as a technician. This can set you apart from the competition and may be instrumental in landing future jobs.\r\n\r\nThe PTCB does provide practice tests on its website, which will give you the option to try the exam yourself. This is a 90-question exam, with 80 questions being scored and 10 being un-scored. You are given one hour and fifty minutes to complete the test.\r\n\r\nSubjects covered by the exam include:\r\n\r\n- Pharmacology\r\n- Pharmacokinetics\r\n- Pharmacy Law\r\n- Billing and Reimbursement\r\n- Information Systems Application\r\n- Sterile and Non-Sterile Compounding\r\n- Pharmacy Quality Assurance\r\n- Medication Safety\r\n\r\n## Is This Job Right For You?\r\n\r\nWhile anyone can study to become a pharmacy technician, different people will of course stand to gain different things from the experience. There are also certain skills and attributes that will make a person especially suited to the job.\r\n\r\nFor example, familiarity with IT (Information Technology) is important, as computers and software will be necessary for a lot of inventory tracking, financial transactions, and more. Math can also be advantageous, as can a knowledge of biology and medicine.\r\n\r\nInterpersonal skills such as active listening, customer service, clerical skills, and more can be very useful too.\r\n\r\n## Salary and Lifestyle\r\n\r\nAs a pharmacy technician, you will enjoy a healthy salary of around $30,920 per year according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\r\n\r\nThis is a profession that will likely always be in demand, and that is enjoying impressive job growth. Right now, the market is experiencing a job growth of around 9-13%, and this is thought to be around 12% to at least 2026.\r\n\r\nWhy is this job growing in demand? That’s because of the aging population. With baby boomers reaching older age, this places an increase demand on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole. In order to handle more orders and customers, more technicians are in demand!\r\n\r\nAs a pharmacy technician, you will be given a lot of responsible for the health, happiness, and well-being of others. Your ability to provide the right medication to the right person will be instrumental in ensuring their health and recovery. Some people will shy away from such responsibility, but others find it to be highly rewarding as they know they are making a positive difference in someone’s life.\r\n\r\nIf you think you would fall into the latter camp, then becoming a pharmacy technician will provide a challenging, rewarding, and secure career that is growing in demand all the time!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nA checking account is a bank account that provides easy access to your cash. This is what is also sometimes called a “current account,” or “transaction account.” As the main account you’ll be using on a day-to-day basis, it’s important that you choose the best one. This will not only impact your finances by helping you to grow your liquid assets, but will also ensure that managing your money is kept as convenient, smooth, and hassle-free as possible.\r\n\r\nYou may have been bombarded with many bank ads and it is hard to figure out which one is best for you. Let’s explore the factors should you consider when choosing the right account.\r\n\r\n## What to Look for When Choosing a Checking Account\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to choosing a checking account, there are several key factors to look for. Let’s consider each of them and break them all down.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Checking-account.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Interest Rates**\r\n\r\nInterest rates refer to the amount of growth your assets will enjoy while they’re sitting in your checking account. The key thing to recognize here, is that checking accounts typically don’t _offer_ particularly high interest rates. If you’re hoping to grow your pot then, a checking account is really not the right place to put it!\r\n\r\nBut with that said, some accounts will still offer higher rates than others, and it’s certainly worth comparing these in order to get the best deal possible. Every little helps, as they say!\r\n\r\n**Fees**\r\n\r\nThe fees you incur on your checking accounts are also important to keep in mind. Depending on the nature of the account, you might face fees for bounced checks, for going past your overdraft limit, or even for neglecting to use your account enough. In the latter scenario, banks will sometimes charge customers if they fail to regularly pay into the account, or charge bills to the account.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t be a problem for a lot of users, seeing as they should be using these accounts for their day-to-day expenses. But while that’s true, it’s also true that this is a condition that you don’t have to accept: it isn’t the case on all accounts. There is always the chance that at some future point, you will decide to treat your checking account like a savings account, or to open up a secondary checking account. In either scenario, you shouldn’t need to worry that you’re going to start losing money as a result!\r\n\r\n**Bonuses and Offers**\r\n\r\nMany banks will want to incentivize you to open up an account and as such, will offer a range of free offers to sweeten the deal. These can include anything from games consoles and mobile phones, to travel or health insurance.\r\n\r\nWhile the idea of a mobile phone might be very appealing, something like travel insurance can actually offer a much better deal in the long-term and could even bail you out of a very expensive bill!\r\n\r\n**Overdraft**\r\n\r\nAn overdraft is essentially a loan that is attached to your checking account. This means that you can withdraw a certain amount of money past zero, without incurring a penalty. That “loan” typically has extremely low interest, and acts as a safety net in case you are hit with an unexpected bill, or in case you need a few days’ grace until your next pay day. This is _certainly_ much safer than a pay day loan, and it’s a great feature to have in place as long as you are sensible and don’t abuse it<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n**Service**\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider – and something that many people won’t take into account when choosing their checking account – is the quality of the service they will be getting from the bank in question.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that you’ll be using this account every day, and that you will be relying on the lender to help you out if ever you get into trouble.\r\n\r\nConsider a scenario where your card is mistakenly reported stolen and is therefore frozen. How easily can you get in touch with customer service? How long does it take to get through to someone on the phone, and how quickly is the problem resolved? This might be an even bigger issue if you want to get a fee removed, or if you suspect that you may have been a victim of fraud.\r\n\r\nLikewise, you should look at additional services and extras that your bank provides. Particularly useful are online banking services. How comprehensive is the app? Is it easy to log in and see all your transactions? Can you manage other products like your home loan or insurance?\r\n\r\nIn short, you need to consider the reputation of the bank, as well as the specifics of the account itself.\r\n\r\n## Closing Comments\r\n\r\nWith all that in mind, there are many different aspects of a checking account to consider when choosing the best option for you. Be sure to shop around, but remember that this is not going to be your main option for growing your assets!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nA walk-in bathtub is an upright bath that you can simply walk into without needing to climb, bend over, or sit. Of course, the big advantage of any walk-in tub is that this makes it far more accessible for those with mobility issues.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this doesn’t mean a walk-in tub is only an option for those too elderly or unwell to be self-sufficient. A walk-in tub can actually be an important tool for people of any age. That’s firstly because a walk-in tub can be a preventative measure against accidents. Falling in the shower and bath are common occurrences, and by choosing a walk-in tub, you’ll be limiting that possibility significantly.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Walkin-tub.jpg)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, some people might find that climbing in and out of a bathtub can be painful or difficult on their joints and back. Again, this can make a walk-in bathtub a great solution.\r\n\r\nBut there are caveats. Not all walk-in tubs are made equal, and there are definitely some potential drawbacks to be aware of. In this post, we will take a look at the most important things to look for when buying walk-in bathtubs, as well as how to make significant savings on your choice.\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it’s important to understand how a walk-in tub works, and what limitations this imposes. This then allows us to try and work around those limitations in order to get the most satisfactory bathing experience.\r\n\r\nEssentially then, walk-in bathtubs work by using a sliding door that seals the tub once you are inside. You can this way then remain standing, drain the water, and then exit.\r\n\r\nBut this also presents a problem! What it means, is that you can’t fill the bathtub with hot water _until_ you are already in the bath. That means you need to stand in the cold for up to ten minutes waiting for it to fill. Likewise, you also need to wait for the water to fully drain before you can exit again.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nThere are solutions to this problem. The first of course is to shop around for a bathtub that has a slightly higher step (there is still normally a step you must cross over), so long as you are able to get over it. This will mean you don’t need the bath to be fully empty when entering or exit.\r\n\r\nAnother of course is to look for a bathtub that fills and drains as quickly as possible. This will minimize the amount of time you are left waiting.\r\n\r\nFinally, consider walk-in bathtubs that offer smart solutions to these kinds of problems. For instance, some walk-in bathtubs come with moats of sorts and drains that can help catch water that splashes over. Others will let you raise and lower the step in order to find the right balance between accessibility and convenience for you.\r\n\r\nFinally, consider the option of a slide-in-tub<sup>1</sup>. This has a door that opens up to pen the side of the bath seat, rather than the whole bath. This then lets you “slide in.” These types of design actually have some benefits in terms of both accessibility and comfort.\r\n\r\n## Getting Your Bath for Less\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to making a saving on your bathtub, there are a few things to consider.\r\n\r\nFirstly: don’t cut too many corners and end up with an inferior product. While this might be tempting, the truth is that this is a device that will need to grow with you.\r\n\r\nAnother tip is to consider the cost of installation, as well as the cost of the bath itself: factor this in when you are working out your available budget.\r\n\r\nThink as well about alternative options. For example, would you prefer a wet room? A wet room effectively turns the entire bathroom into a large shower. This then allows you to place any normal chair that won’t be damaged by moisture in the corner of the room, and to then sit on that as a means to wash yourself. Showers rather than baths are generally an important consideration when choosing your bathroom conversion.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative option is a transfer chair. This can be used to transfer you into a regular bath, regardless of your current set-up – which can in turn avoid the need for a replacement tub altogether.\r\n\r\n## Insurance and VAT\r\n\r\nRemember: you are not carrying out this bathroom renovation purely for luxury reasons or aesthetics. This is a renovation intended to improve the quality of your life, and the ability to wash should be considered a minimum right for all people.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, there may also be some ways to get cashback on this process. A good example is VAT exemption on goods. This applies in many parts of the world<sup>2</sup>. Meanwhile, some forms of insurance will cover your expenses here, and you may even be able to get grants and charity support.\r\n\r\nEven with this help though, be sure to treat this as the very important decision that it is. Remember that you won’t just be living with your choice for the coming year, but likely for years to follow – during which time your mobility and health could deteriorate further. Don’t buy the bathtub that you need right now, buy the one that you will need in 5 years’ time.\r\n\r\n<sup> </sup>\r\n\r\n1.

This, can make everything from getting a home, to driving a car, much more difficult. And seeing as these expenses aren’t avoidable, it ultimately leads to spiraling debt and a seemingly inescapable situation.\r\n\r\nSo before you can do anything else to improve your financial situation, you first need to fix your credit score. Let’s take a look at everything you need to know, and how precisely you can go about doing that.\r\n\r\n## What is a Credit Score?\r\n\r\nFirst, it can be helpful to understand what a credit score is and how it works in order to become better at manipulating them and fixing your financial situation.\r\n\r\nBasically then, a credit score is a mark against your name that is used by lenders and other companies in order to identify how reliable you are at paying back loans and honoring your commitments. Lenders need to be able to rely on their customers to pay the money back in order to make profit and thus they need to be discriminating when choosing who to lend to. If you fail to pay off a loan you’ve been given then, they will often respond by putting a mark against your name so that future lenders know to be wary.\r\n\r\nThis way, those companies work together in order to ‘blacklist’ people who they deem unable to pay back the money they borrow. If you are one of those people, it makes it very hard for you to then get the loans you need. If you _can_ get a loan, then the interest will be high because the companies will need to cover themselves against things potentially going wrong.\r\n\r\n## What is the Highest Credit Score?\r\n\r\nAs it happens, there is actually more than one type of credit score system. You know, in case it wasn’t confusing enough already!\r\n\r\nThe good news though is that most lenders will use the same one: that being your FICO score (Fair Isaac Corp). FICO scores can be anywhere from 300 to 850 and it’s considered that the higher the number, the better your credit score.\r\n\r\nSo right away this might give you a good indication as to what a good score might look like.\r\n\r\nTo break it down further though:\r\n\r\n- Bad credit is considered to be anything between 300-626\r\n- Average credit is between 630-689\r\n- Good credit is 690-719\r\n- And ‘excellent’ credit is 720\r\n\r\nThe highest credit score you can possibly get is 850<sup>1</sup>. This then means that you’ve demonstrated to all previous banks and lenders that you’re able to always pay your debts on time, that you have lots of money saved up, that you’re financial stable and that you’re generally a very good customer.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean from your perspective? Essentially, it means that people will be keen to give you loans, happy for you to set up standing orders and generally trusting of you when you make any type of financial commitment.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not just that you’ll find it easier to get loans. At the same time, you’ll also find it easier to get those loans for a good price. Because you represent less of a risk, banks will be able to charge you less for using their services which means you will pay less in total when you pay the loan back.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you should find that you can pay your loan off more flexibly. The bank will be happy for you to commit to pay it off fast _or_ to pay it slowly over a long time.\r\n\r\nAnd ironically of course, having a high credit means that you’ll be able to make it _even higher_ in future. Why? Because with lower interest rates and more convenient repayment structures you’ll be less likely to get into more financial trouble.\r\n\r\nThere’s one more important reason to gun for great credit too – and that’s that it’s indicative of someone who has been generally smart and sensible with their money. If you have good credit, it means you aren’t taking risks and this means you’re less likely to end up in trouble.\r\n\r\n### How to Get There\r\n\r\nSo having the top credit score is a great position to be in. The question is: how do you get there?\r\n\r\n**Tip 1: Pay Off Your Debt**\r\n\r\nThe most important thing you can do, is to pay off all your outstanding debt so that you don’t owe anyone anything. This will win you points for completing contracts and the signal you’ll be sending is that you are capable of paying off loans you are given.\r\n\r\nThis is _especially_ true for any outstanding debts or any missed payments. If you have a lot of credit card debt for instance that should have been paid off a long time ago, you should pay it off as soon as possible to avoid being further penalized for late payments.\r\n\r\nOf course it’s not always as easily done as said but what you should do is to prioritize the repayment of debts and loans that are the most pressing. Anything that is causing you to lose sleep at night is probably also hurting your credit score. That goes first.\r\n\r\n**Tip 2: Be Reliable**\r\n\r\nFor all future debts and payments likewise, make sure that you pay regularly, on-time and reliably. Your objective is to never miss a beat, so if you often are, try budgeting better and being stricter with your outgoings. The same goes for mobile phone payments and even checks. A bounced check can actually do damage to your credit rating too.\r\n\r\n**Tip 3: Take Out a Credit Card or Loan**\r\n\r\nBut what if you don’t have any debts to pay off?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how credit scores work, it follows that you need to _take out_ loans in order to repair your credit history. This might seem counter-intuitive but the idea is to prove that you _can_ pay back loans now. Taking out loans and paying them promptly and efficiently simply proves this to the financial institutions.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this is to take out a credit card and to use it only for small payments. A common choice is to use a credit card only to pay for gasoline. From there, you then simply make sure that you always pay off the credit card at the end of the month without missing a payment and that way you can be sure that you’ll be gradually improving your rating again.\r\n\r\nWhen doing this, you should also try to avoid spending more than 25% of your available limit. This way you’ll demonstrate ‘low utilization’ and this is something that credit card companies consider to be a sign that you are ‘low risk’.\r\n\r\n**Tip 4: Check Your Credit Score**\r\n\r\nAnother tip is to check your credit score regularly. This is a good idea because it lets you know whether there are any problems or red flags. Make sure you are careful though because in some cases you’ll find that just checking your credit score can affect it. Choose the right service to do this with.\r\n\r\n**Tip 5: Remove Links**\r\n\r\nWhat kind of ‘red flags’ can crop up when checking a credit score though? One example is that you might find you’re still linked to someone from your past. This could be an ex-spouse for instance, someone you held a joint account with, or someone you just lived with. In these scenarios, your finances and credit scores will be intertwined to the point where if that person has a bad credit score, it will affect yours as well.\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can fix this problem by filling out a ‘disassociation form’ which will help you to remove that connection. Of course an association with someone with a very healthy credit score can actually be a good thing!\r\n\r\n**Tip 6: Close Accounts You Aren’t Using**\r\n\r\nCredit companies don’t just look at how much you owe – they also look at the funds and credit ‘available to you’. So if you have a credit card that you aren’t using, then another credit card company might be less likely to want to lend you money. Remove this restriction by closing any unwanted accounts and generally keeping your finances in order.\r\n\r\n**Tip 7: Update Your Information**\r\n\r\nUpdating your information is also an important step to repairing your credit score and strengthening it. Particularly useful is to register to vote at your current address. Doing this will allow credit companies to more easily protect themselves against fraud and this can help you to get loans with less hassle.\r\n\r\n**Tip 8: Space Out Your Requests**\r\n\r\nAsking for lots of loans in a single year is more damaging than asking for the same number of loans across several years. Plan ahead and try to space out your requests as much as possible to improve your chances of getting a positive response.\r\n\r\nFollow these tips and you should be well on your way to improving your credit score once and for all!\r\n\r\nSo now you know how to improve your credit score and to get on the path to being financially healthy. While it might seem like a lot of work and a long way away, the truth is that the destination more than makes up for the journey. Good luck!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nLung cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer. In fact, 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers, and the America Cancer Society estimates that there were 234,030 cases of lung cancer in the US during 2018 alone. That includes 154,050 deaths<sup>1</sup>. There is a 1 in 17 chance of anyone being diagnosed with lung cancer at some point during their lives, and those diagnoses include a 5-year relative survival rate of only 61%. These statistics may be frightening, but it’s important to recognize that there are many lung cancer treatment options, and that the sooner you act, the better your chances of a full recover.\r\n\r\nThat 61% survival rate statistic refers specifically to localized lung cancer. This means cancer that only affects the lung, and that has not spread into the bones, blood, or nearby organs. For regional lung cancer that has spread to surrounding tissue, the survival rate is only 35%, and this falls even further for the “Distant” SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) stage down to 6%. The 5-year relative survival rate for all SEER stages is 24%.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Lung-cancer.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe survival rates for small cell cancer are lower again.\r\n\r\nWhat’s key to take away from this, is that lung cancer is an extremely serious condition, but also one that is more dangerous the longer it is allowed to continue. If you can identify and begin to treat the condition early, then you will have a survival rate that is better than 50%.\r\n\r\n## How Lung Cancer Forms\r\n\r\nLung cancer forms due to mutations in the cells, and specifically damage to the DNA. Every single cell contains a nucleus (its center), that in turn houses DNA. This is a strand of proteins that contains a special genetic code that instructs the cell on how to behave. It’s thanks to DNA that cells know where to sit in the body, what proteins to produce, when to die, and more.\r\n\r\nOver time, cells die and need to be replenished via a process called mitosis. Here, the cell will split in half and create a perfectly identical copy of itself. This copy is formed using the DNA as a basis.\r\n\r\nOver time, cells receive damage. Usually, this is external damage to the cell wall, and has no negative effect on the body at large. However, in some cases, that damage is able to penetrate all the way through to the DNA. When this happens, the DNA can become damaged and the cell thereby stops functioning properly. It might no-longer produce the correct proteins, or it might stop communicating with those around it. In some cases it won’t die, and in others, it will reproduce wantonly.\r\n\r\nMost of us have cells like this in our body (that would technically be considered cancerous cells) but they are small enough that this doesn’t cause a problem. Eventually they die, and the body maintains its normal balance.\r\n\r\nBut if that cell should split and reproduce via mitosis, then it’s going to create an exact copy of itself as it is in that moment. In other words, you will now have two identical cancerous cells that don’t perform properly.\r\n\r\nEach time that cell splits and divides, this same process is going to occur again and again. Eventually, a large area of tissue will be made up entirely of cancer cells, which is what we call a tumor.\r\n\r\nThe longer the cancer is allowed to continue, the larger the tumor will grow. Eventually, this can prevent the organ from functioning properly (the lung in this case) and increase the risk of the cancer cells spreading to other parts of the body.\r\n\r\n## Treatment Options\r\n\r\nThere are 5 main treatment options for addressing lung cancer. These are:\r\n\r\n- Surgery\r\n- Radiation\r\n- Chemotherapy\r\n- Targeted therapy\r\n- Immunotherapy\r\n\r\nSurgical treatments involve removing the tumor from the lung, or removing the lung entirely in some case. The latter is called a pneumonectomy and is considered a last resort. Other options include lobectomy (removing one lobe of the lung), a wedge resection, or a segmentectomy. A surgeon will need to balance removing as much of the tumor as possible, while leaving as much lung intact as they can.\r\n\r\nRadiation therapy involves using beams of x-rays against the affected area in order to try to destroy the cancer cells. This can also damage healthy tissue surrounding the cancer cells however. This can lead to fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and other conditions.\r\n\r\nChemotherapy works in a similar manner to radiation therapy, using drugs in order to destroy cells. Again, this can affect both cancerous cells and healthy cells, but is less precise than radiation therapy. This means that the chemotherapy can cause many unwanted side effects such as hair loss, sickness, weight loss, and more. Chemotherapy is effective against progressive forms of lung cancer however.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, a physician may recommend the use of radiation therapy or chemotherapy following surgery in order to destroy any remaining cells.\r\n\r\nTargeted therapy is a type of therapy that involves targeting specific genes and proteins that encourage the growth and survival of tumor cells. These include anti-angiogenesis therapy for instance, which works by reducing the formation of new blood cells (tumors need a source of blood in order to survive and grow). Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors work by preventing the growth and development of tumors.\r\n\r\nFinally, immunotherapy aims to support the body’s own immune system in combating cancerous cells in order to provide a recovery with minimal symptoms. This method is difficult to measure and manage however.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to do is to discuss with your physician which options are better for you. They will go into much greater detail discussing various lung cancer treatment options, and provide help, support, and advice during this difficult time.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nBecoming a nurse is an extremely rewarding job that will put you in direct contact with patients as you help them to get through difficult times in their lives. You will be responsible for carrying out many medical procedures, while keeping them calm and at ease, and assisting doctors in their treatments. This is a job that will always be in demand, and that is growing increasingly in-demand. With that in mind, read on and learn everything you need to know about nursing degrees and whether they are right for you.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Nurse.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Nursing Degrees 101\r\n\r\nThe first thing to know about nursing degrees, is that they come in a variety of different flavors<sup>1</sup>. These include:\r\n\r\n- Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN)\r\n- Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)\r\n- RN-to-BSN\r\n\r\nASNs will last for two years, and are ideally aimed at those looking to enter the workforce as soon as they can. With that said, many hospitals will look for BSNs which are more comprehensive – so keep this in mind.\r\n\r\nA BSN is a degree qualification. This requires a higher level of commitment, but this pays off with better job opportunities. The BSN typically takes four years.\r\n\r\nThe RN to BSN is aimed at those looking to bump up their ASN to a BSN.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing a nursing degree, you should always look for accreditation. This should come from the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing<sup>2</sup> or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nNursing degrees are expensive, just as all undergraduate degrees are. However, it is possible to gain a scholarship if you are willing to do the research.\r\n\r\nIn order to get onto a nursing degree, you will need to have studied either a social science or biology subject at school. Common options include psychology, sociology, chemistry, and biology.\r\n\r\n## What to Expect\r\n\r\nStudying to become a nurse involves a combination of written theory and practical hands-on experience. You will be required to gain real-world experience working in simulation laboratories to practice various procedures, and even in hospitals where they may shadow other experienced nurses or even be given the chance to take care of sick patients. In fact, a typical nursing degree is divided roughly 50/50 between practical work and theoretical study.\r\n\r\nThe first year of study will normally focus on basic clinical concepts and procedures across all four “disciplines” of nursing.\r\n\r\nFrom the second year of nursing, you will be required to choose to specialize in one of the following four areas<sup>4</sup>\r\n\r\n- Adult nursing degree – This allows you to work in most settings, and covers public health, complex care, leadership, and management\r\n- Children’s nursing degree – This is aimed at nurses who wish to focus their care on children. This can also be useful for those looking to work in a school or hospice.\r\n- Learning disabilities nursing degree – This is aimed at nurses looking to work with adults and children with learning disabilities.\r\n- Mental health nursing degree – This focuses specifically on supporting the physical and mental health of those with mental health illnesses.\r\n\r\nNursing degrees are extremely challenging and in-depth programs. You will learn about human biology in great detail, ranging from the cardiovascular system, to the skeletal system, to the action potentials of neurons. While your job will not be to treat patients or diagnose them without the supervision of a physician, you will still be expected to be able to recognize basic conditions, and to demonstrate an understanding of how they affect the body.\r\n\r\nOn top of this scientific training, you will also learn how to interact with patients, as well as how to operate advanced machinery. Being required to practice this in person can place students in high-pressure scenarios, not to mention requiring a strong stomach when it comes to the sight of blood or other bodily fluids!\r\n\r\nNote that working in a hospital is not your only option upon graduation. Nursing degrees can likewise lead to working in schools, hospices, assisted living communities, charities, and more.\r\n\r\n## Closing Comments\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to put in the time and effort, if you are not easily scared or upset, and if you like the sounds of being able to help people while also learning about the human body, then nursing may be for you. A nursing degree will be a challenge, but one that can lead to high employability, a healthy salary, and a true sense of job satisfaction.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nLuxury assisted living may sound like a little bit of marketing hyperbole, but it’s actually a very appealing prospect for those that are looking to make the most of their retirement. What’s more, is that it is actually surprisingly affordable – especially right now. If you’re interested in luxury assisted living, then there has simply never been a better time.\r\n\r\n## Why Luxury Assisted Living is Cheaper Than Ever\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in luxury assisted living and you don’t want to break the bank, this is definitely the time to consider getting a place.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Senior-living.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that at the moment, the supply greatly outstrips the demand. This is owing to a huge boom in development for these types of properties and living arrangements, with many companies and organizations investing heavily in senior accommodation.\r\n\r\nAs you may know the population is generally getting older, and this is increasing at a drastic rate. It is thought that the number of people over 65 is going to double by 2060<sup>1</sup>. In order to accommodate for these elderly citizens, companies and governments have invested heavily in infrastructure and property development. Seeing as building homes takes time, it’s not enough to wait until the numbers have boomed to then try and quickly develop the necessary homes: instead, developers need to act **now** in order to ensure that the property is already there when it is needed.\r\n\r\nThat means that the number of spots for luxury assisted living has gone up dramatically, and right now there isn’t yet the population to fill those places.\r\n\r\nAny empty space like this costs a lot of money for the companies that own these sites: they still have to keep them clean, maintained, and presentable. Therefore, they are willing to sell them at a lower price, simply to fill the spaces.\r\n\r\nThe other issue for these new developments is that they need a certain patronage in order to start attracting **more** new residents. People move into luxury assisted living partly because they want to spend time around people of a similar age. Often, arranged activities and social events are among the biggest draws that attract people to this kind of living arrangement in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo if the property is a ghost-town, no one is going to want to move there! You can’t really sell a _community_ without people.\r\n\r\nBy moving into a newer luxury assisted living location, you can enjoy the quality of life that comes from a premium experience, the peace of mind that comes from any new property, but the low price that comes from a lack of demand!\r\n\r\n## About Luxury Assisted Living\r\n\r\nSo just what is luxury assisted living, and why might it be right for you?\r\n\r\nEssentially, luxury assisted living aims to provide the on-site care and support that you may need as you get older, but in a more premium fashion.\r\n\r\nDisability often leaves us dependent on others for our meals, help with shopping, medication, housekeeping, and even bathing and dressing. This can force people into retirement homes where they see their freedom and independence eroded. Often these homes also offer a lower standard of living with regards to the quality of the premises themselves: furniture might be old and tattered, and activities might be limited to bingo. For those that are otherwise healthy, this can feel like a jail sentence.\r\n\r\nLuxury assisted living offers all the same services but with many more options: including educational opportunities, more exciting activities, and lots of communal areas for socializing. They’ll often provide plush rooms and facilities, not to mention higher quality meals.\r\n\r\nThe average price of luxury assisted living is around $4,000<sup>2 </sup>per month up to $5,500. This is a lot of money and will be prohibitive for some people – though it’s also going to have a big impact on your comfort, health, and happiness. Fortunately, if you follow our advice and try to secure a place early in a new development, you can often get the price for lower.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t be afraid to do a little bit of haggling! Companies will try to sell you on the premium experience, but **you know** that they are desperate to get more people onto their premises so that they can start to operate their business fully. Armed with this knowledge, you can often bring down the rates, or alternatively improve the number of services and amenities available to you.\r\n\r\n1.

In this post, we will examine this in detail.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Prepper-investment.jpg)\r\n\r\nA prepper is someone who has taken it upon themselves to prepare for the worst outcomes.

This post will share the best strategies.\r\n\r\n## Inverse ETF and Short Selling\r\n\r\nETF stands for exchange-traded fund<sup>1</sup>, which is a system that allows you to profit from a decline. When the major indexes drop, your net-worth goes up! So how does this work? Essentially, you are buying derivative contracts such as “swaps.” These let you exchanges multiple underlying assets, which might mean trading with hundreds of stocks for instance.\r\n\r\nInverse ETF means that you are short selling a stock – expecting a decline in value and therefore repurchasing it at a lower price. Make sure that you know the difference between an ETN (exchange traded note) and ETF.\r\n\r\nIt’s also possible to short sell regular stocks and shares, but by combining the value of multiple shares, you are betting on larger market trends: such as the economic downturn that you see coming.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can’t rely on the market plummeting either, but if you use this as part of a short-term hedge fund, and include it in a more diverse portfolio, then it can act as some assurance and help to ensure you continue making some profit no matter which way the tides swing.\r\n\r\n## Binary Options\r\n\r\nBinary options trading basically means playing the stock market by making ‘binary’ decisions. Here you will look at the value of an asset and say whether it will go “up” or “down” by a certain date by calling or putting. As long as the value of the asset is higher or lower as you predicted by the agreed date, you then receive a set payout. Another type of binary trading is called “boundary options trading” wherein you receive your payout if the asset breaks a specific boundary<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about binary options trading is that it’s simple to understand, it’s fast to play, and you know exactly how much you stand to earn and when. And this appeals to preppers for a couple of big reasons: firstly, it allows you to make a quick profit with no long-term investment necessary. Binary options are used by “day traders” who will often buy and sell shares in minutes, thereby profiting from tiny fluctuations and making a lot of money, very quickly.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it once again means that you can bet **against** the market. You are profiting here from fluctuations in the market, rather than simply relying on it going up. This again means that you can put your pessimism to good use, and thereby bet against the market.\r\n\r\nBut in order to make money from binary options, you need to approach it with the right tactic just as you do with any type of trading.\r\n\r\nWhen trading any kinds of assets, it makes sense to “spread your bets” by investing in different types. Invest in stocks for instance as well as precious metals and currencies. This way, you’ll be less likely to see all your options get hurt at the same time.\r\n\r\nThere are also various different types of binary options. Boundary binary options, call-put binary options and others like one-touch options. Try combining a few of these to see which works best for your particular trading strategy.\r\n\r\nAnother way that options trading can vary is in its time to expiration. 60 seconds binary options are options that expire in just 60 seconds, which is an exciting and fast way to make money. The downside of course is that it’s also a fast way to _lose_ money.\r\n\r\nAgain, a good strategy is to mix and match. Have a few relatively ‘safe’ long term options that you know will keep you safe but then try a few faster 60 seconds options that have the potential to help you earn more money more quickly. That way, you can maximize your potential earnings without risking all of your money.\r\n\r\n## Resilient Shares\r\n\r\nThere are some types of business that are going to be resilient even in an economic crash. For example, you will often hear that commodities are a safe bet. Even in a doomsday scenario, certain supplies such as basic foods, gas, and oil will continue to be in demand. In fact, you could expect a serious event to cause gas and oil to soar.\r\n\r\nIf you are worrying about slightly less catastrophic events – like a good old-fashioned economic downturn – then you might also be wise to invest in gambling, and alcohol. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these are two types of business that actually prove to be somewhat resilient during times of economic hardship. When people are broke, they get desperate and try gambling. And when that doesn’t work… they turn to alcohol!\r\n\r\n## Trade the News\r\n\r\nTrading the news means keeping up-to-date with current events and thus being able to better predict what the immediate future might look like. Knowing a little history even can help you to make smarter decisions.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is useful is that current events can very often impact on the value of various assets – especially if you’re trading forex but just as likely if you’re trading stocks and shares. Financial crises hurt assets across the board (almost – gambling companies and some other industries do well in a recession) while the news can also report on events specific to certain industries (such as the struggling supermarkets at the moment). All this information can help you to make a better judgement when deciding if a certain asset is likely to go up or down in the near future.\r\n\r\nIf you are someone who is fearful that things are only getting worse, then watching the news and looking for opportunities can be a great way to profit from that heightened sense of gloom!\r\n\r\n## Tangible Assets\r\n\r\nTangible assets include the likes of gold and silver, as well as jewelry, collectible coins, and the like. We’ve already discussed why these might be effective as binary options, but they are also one of the most popular long-term investment options for preppers.\r\n\r\nYou can prepare for your future using a gold IRA for instance, and in doing so, you know that your money isn’t being held in an abstract cyberspace vault. Rather, you have bought something solid and real that will always exist and that will always have at least SOME inherent value.\r\n\r\nGold gets its value from scarcity, meaning that until someone learns to print more of it, it’s always going to be a safe investment option!\r\n\r\nLooking for more safe investment options?

      "content": "\r\nArthritis is a highly painful and disruptive disability that affects millions of people globally. In fact, arthritis is the number one cause of disability in the Western World<sup>1</sup> and can become so severe as to leave an individual permanently bed-ridden and in severe discomfort. Over 20 million people experience severe arthritis.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately though, arthritis is also a highly misunderstood problem. Many people do not recognize the severity of arthritis for instance, writing it off merely as ‘joint pain’. Likewise, many people fail to recognize the huge variety of conditions that can fall under the broad umbrella term ‘arthritis’. Actually, there are over 100 different forms of the condition, all of which range in severity and vary in terms of the area they affect. This makes arthritis particularly hard to manage and unfortunately, there is currently no known ‘cure’ for most forms of the condition.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Arthritis.jpg)\r\n\r\nBut just because there’s no cure, that does not mean that you have to struggle alone with the condition. Arthritis therapy is a form of therapy provided by physiotherapists and which can provide significant relief. If you are suffering with arthritis pain, then it’s important that you recognize the nature and seriousness of the problem and seek medical attention as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n## What Does Arthritis Therapy Involve?\r\n\r\nAs there is no cure for arthritis, therapy will always focus on minimizing pain and discomfort and managing the condition.\r\n\r\nThis can in turn include a number of different approaches which might vary depending on the type of arthritis, the location and the severity.\r\n\r\nManipulation and massage for instance can sometimes be used to try and restore mobility, reduce pain and encourage circulation to the affected area. At the same time, therapists might provide the patient with exercises that they can use themselves on a more regular basis to improve their flexibility and reduce swelling. These exercises can also be used to try and slow down the progression of joint pain and to maintain normal flexibility and movement.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t _use_ a particular joint, then this can lead to decreased movement and increased pain. However, the wrong type of movement can end up causing a lot of pain or damaging the area further – and for these reasons it’s often advisable to seek consultation regarding the best type of movement to encourage healing.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, your physiotherapist might also be able to recommend certain types of medication and can assess things like your diet and routine to see how this might affect your general health. Arthritis pain is largely caused by inflammation. In some cases, this inflammation is a result of a previous injury or repetitive strain. In others, it can be a result of the immune system attacking itself. Medication and certain dietary methods can help to reduce swelling, soothe pain and ensure a healthier response from the body. A physiotherapist can also recommend rest, elevation and other techniques as necessary and generally help you to make the best decisions for your health and for encouraging a speedy recovery.\r\n\r\n## Supplements That Help Arthritis\r\n\r\n- If you are not eating plenty of fatty fish regularly, supplement with fish oil. Fish oil has been proven to fight inflammation and help with a number of different diseases. This works by changing the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6, which in turn can reduce the inflammation.\r\n- Talk to your primary care physician about getting on low-dose aspirin therapy, which would mean taking one or two baby aspirins per day. It sounds silly, but it’s actually a common practice. It can help reduce inflammation in the body. Baby aspirin therapy has long been a part of cancer prevention<sup>2</sup>.\r\n- Start taking coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Take up to 100 mg with your biggest meal of the day.\r\n- If you have a risk of developing metabolic syndrome, start taking alpha-lipoic acid. Take between 100-400 milligrams a day.\r\n- Vanilla extract is a highly potent anti-inflammatory supplement<sup>3</sup>.\r\n- Capsaicin is also an effective anti-inflammatory agent (don’t be confused by its role in occasional neurogenic inflammation). It also helps to reduce perception of pain, by modulating production of the brain chemical “substance P.”<sup>4</sup>\r\n\r\nLikewise, changing your diet and aiming to consume fewer inflammatory foods (such as highly processed foods and sugars) can also make a big different.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nA gold IRA may just offer one of the most reliable, profitable, and financially-smart options to help you prepare for your retirement. Why not check out some of the amazing plans below to get started, or read on to learn more about how it all works.\r\n\r\nCountless people have faced the terrible reality of losing the savings they worked for all their lives as a result of our unstable economy. These people have been left with nothing and are often forced to work well past their retirement age just to make ends meet.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/gold-163519.jpg)\r\n\r\nWith threats like hyperinflation and the falling US dollar to contend with, there are increasingly few safe options for keeping your assets secured. Fortunately, one good choice still exists: which is to put your money into a gold IRA.\r\n\r\nGold IRAs offer probably _the_ most secure option for keeping your money safe, but it’s important to familiarize yourself with what they are and how they work before you go ahead. Read on and we’ll take a look at some of the important things you need to know about gold IRAs before you start your investment.\r\n\r\n## Is a Gold IRA Really Secure?\r\n\r\nYou’ve probably heard that gold IRAs are the most secure form of investment for your retirement funds but is this really true?\r\n\r\nThe good news is that your money _really is_ safer when you put it into a gold IRA<sup>1</sup>. The reason for this is that gold is immune to many of the factors that make financial investments so unstable.\r\n\r\nFinancial investments include currency, stock and bond investments, and more. Unfortunately, these are greatly affected by things like hyperinflation, devaluation, and economic difficulties. This means they will often rise and fall in value. The same is true for some physical assets too – including property.\r\n\r\nWhen investing in gold however, your money is much more likely to remain safe and secure.\r\n\r\nThis is because gold _maintains its value even during economic turmoil._ In fact, _gold often rises in value during these times_. This gives gold a huge advantage as an investment option, particularly when the economy is struggling.\r\n\r\n## Can You Make Money From a Gold IRA?\r\n\r\nMany people choose gold IRAs because they want to keep their money safe. As with other forms of investment however, gold IRAs can also give you good returns over time<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nThis is because gold doesn’t just retain its value, but also often increases in value. This makes it absolutely possible to make a profit when you invest your money in gold.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when the recession began during 2008, the value of gold increased significantly. Those who had invested in stocks and bonds lost a lot of money during this time, while those with gold IRAs were making profits!\r\n\r\nThe fact that gold goes _up in value_ during economic downturns is one of the best advantages of choosing a gold IRA.\r\n\r\n## Can You Rollover Existing IRAs Into a Gold IRA?\r\n\r\nAnother important factor to think about is the fact that existing IRAs can be “rolled over” into gold IRAs.\r\n\r\nWhile precise situations vary, in the vast majority of cases your money can easily be moved from an account such as a 401k into a gold IRA. Unlike transferring money between financial accounts however, rolling over into a gold IRA doesn’t incur any tax penalties when done correctly.\r\n\r\nFor this to work though it’s very important that the process be handled _correctly_ by a competent organization. For instance, the process must be completed within 60 days of starting<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\n## How to Transfer 401k to Gold IRA\r\n\r\nBut why would you want to do this? As implied earlier, if your savings are in a 401k, then they may not be safe.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, 401ks are no longer a secure option for savings and there have been countless cases of hard working Americans losing money invested in this way due to recession.\r\n\r\nThere are many issues with 401ks that make them unsecure options. Including:\r\n\r\n**Vulnerability:** 401ks are highly vulnerable to factors that are outside of your control, such as hyperinflation and the falling US dollar.\r\n\r\n**Administrative Costs:** It is very expensive for employers to provide 401ks and often they will pass these costs on to you in the form of various fees.\r\n\r\n**Risky Investment Options:** 401ks offer you a variety of investment options but these are typically all somewhat risky. All these options are vulnerable to factors influencing the economy and the dollar as described above. Ask yourself, do you feel as though we’re moving into a period of political (and therefore economic) certainty? Me neither.\r\n\r\n**Complex Tax Laws:** 401ks come with a number of complicated tax laws and when you combine the taxes you’ll pay with fees, they become significantly less viable.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, 401ks are often _not_ the best choice for your investments. Fortunately, there are better and safer options out there: such as gold IRAs.\r\n\r\n## Why Transfer 401k to Gold IRA?\r\n\r\nThere are lots of advantages to having a gold IRA that make it a far better option compared with 401ks. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n**Protection from Hyperinflation:** Gold is resistant to hyperinflation and even if the government prints more money, it won’t affect your investment.\r\n\r\n**Increases in Value During Recessions:** While financial assets and many physical assets will suffer during harsh economic times, gold actually tends to do the exact opposite and has been proven to _increase_ in value in most cases.\r\n\r\n**Deferred Taxes:** Taxes are much simpler and more affordable with gold IRAs. When you use these accounts you will get a tax deferred status until you decide to withdraw.\r\n\r\n## Transfer vs. Rollover\r\n\r\nThe best way to transfer your money from a 401k to a gold IRA is to do what’s called a ‘rollover’. The option to do this is actually another advantage that sets gold IRAs apart. Here’s the difference:\r\n\r\n_Transfer_\r\n\r\nWhen transferring money between savings accounts you will often do so directly using check or similar. Unfortunately, this process also often means you lose your tax deferred status.\r\n\r\n_Rollover_\r\n\r\nWhen you move your money into a gold IRA however, the process is different. Here the money will go from your current IRA, to you, and then to your new custodian (the company handling your gold IRA). This might sound more complicated but the big advantage is that you don’t lose your tax deferred status so there is nothing extra to pay.\r\n\r\nThis makes a rollover significantly better than a transfer as you don’t risk having to pay hefty taxes.\r\n\r\nThere are some regulations to consider though.\r\n\r\n## Rollover Regulations\r\n\r\nWhen rolling over money from a 401k to a gold IRA, there are some stipulations you need to be aware of:\r\n\r\n_60 Day Window_\r\n\r\nWhen performing your rollover, you need to ensure that it is completed within 60 days of the starting time.\r\n\r\n_12 Month Limit_\r\n\r\nThe same assets can only be rolled over once a year.\r\n\r\nThe best gold custodians will handle this process for you while making sure that you meet all these requirements and avoid any tax penalties. Shop around to find a company that offers rollover services and your life will be made significantly easier!\r\n\r\n## Closing Comments\r\n\r\nAs you can see then, gold is a savvy investment for many people and a Gold IRA presents a great way to prepare for your retirement. There are detractors that suggest that investing in gold is more volatile than its traditional reputation as a “safe haven” seems to imply. But even taking that into account, there are ways to invest in gold that are tied to its smaller fluctuations. If you prefer this option, you can still choose tangible assets.\r\n\r\nAnd moreover, in a world that is increasingly intangible and based on commonly held beliefs, there is something reassuring about having a vat of cold, hard gold somewhere with your name on it. You won’t change our minds that a Gold IRA is one of the safest ways to prepare for the future.\r\n\r\nWhy not check out some of the links below to get started, and to future proof your own retirement plan?\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nAs a dental assistant, you’ll enjoy a job that is always in demand, that has a healthy salary, and that provides the opportunity to genuinely help people. It’s medical and scientific, without requiring huge amounts of training as would be necessary to become a nurse, doctor, or dentist. In this post, we will examine this profession in detail.\r\n\r\n## What Does a Dental Assistant Do?\r\n\r\nThe role of a dental assistant is to help assist the dentist in any way they can. This can involve a number of key roles, ranging from basic admin (arranging and managing appointments, dealing with patient records, and ordering supplies) to clinical duties. Clinical duties can involve handling tools, sterilizing equipment, operating suction devices and others, processing x-rays, making impressions to be used for dental fixtures, and putting the patient at ease during their visit.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Dental-Assistant.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe skills that are required for a dental technician therefore include:\r\n\r\n- Great people skills and bedside manner\r\n- Organization and administrative\r\n- Technically minded\r\n- Quick learner\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in May 2018 that dental assistants were earning a median salary of $38,660. The highest earners received around $54,800. Factors influencing wage included level of experience, geographic factors, and length of employment<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nDental assistant is a future-proof job role, with the demand expecting to grow by 11% between 2018 and 2028. This is much higher than the average for all job growth.\r\n\r\n## Qualifications\r\n\r\nThere are no strict qualifications necessary to become a dental nurse/assistant<sup>2</sup>. Training can be done on the job, which means that you’ll be able to land a role without having prior experience or qualifications.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can study for this job by taking a dental assistant program. These courses tend to last anywhere from nine months to two years, depending on the level of the qualification. Common qualifications include:\r\n\r\n- Diploma\r\n- Certificate\r\n- Degree program\r\n\r\nOf course, the higher your level of training, the more chance you have of landing jobs that you apply to.\r\n\r\nIf you lack directly relevant training as a dental assistant, you may still benefit from tangentially related qualifications and experience. For instance, experience working in administration might provide a useful background and help your CV to stand out among the competition. Similarly, previous experience working in a medical role such as medical coding, could help to give you an edge.\r\n\r\nProspective dental assistants can also complete internships in order to gain additional experience and set themselves apart from the class. Many academic programs provide internships as a voluntary aspect of their coursework, offering more real-world experience and hands-on practice.\r\n\r\n## Choosing a Focus\r\n\r\nThere is actually more than one type of dental assistant, and it is up to you to choose which type of role you want to specialize in. Dental assistants may specialize in pediatric dentistry, endodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, dentofacial orthodontics, or maxillofacial surgery.\r\n\r\n## Certification\r\n\r\nSome states require licensing and certification for dental assistants. To learn more about the laws in your specific area, you can visit the Dental Assisting National Board’s<sup>3</sup> (DANB) website.\r\n\r\nCertification requires students to pass a 320 question exam that is offered at Pearson VUE test centers. This focuses on chair-side manner, radiation health and safety, and infection control. The test has a possible maximum of 900 points, with entrants requiring a score of 400 or above in order to gain certification. You can sit the exam as many times as you wish.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to gain certification and licensing from other bodies, which may further help enhance your resume, and your chances of gaining employment.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo get started, hopeful assistants should first seek out a training course that matches their budget and lifestyle. Ensure that these courses are accredited by the American Dental Association<sup>4</sup> (there are 270 such courses). You should also ensure that all major topics are covered by the course, including:\r\n\r\n- Oral anatomy\r\n- Radiography\r\n- Dental materials\r\n- Clinical dental assisting\r\n\r\nIf you are eager to get qualified quickly, then consider an accelerated program.\r\n\r\nOnce you are ready, you can begin applying to dental assistant roles through job listing sites, or by asking about openings in your local area.\r\n\r\n1.

These then call for help by contacting either the primary care giver, or a medical service that is available around the clock.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/stairs-932806_1920.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhile some people will be resistant to the idea of using medical alert systems – seeing them as a loss of independence – the truth is that this technology actually allows people to _continue_ being independent, while also providing a better quality-of-life for their loved ones.\r\n\r\nIn this post, you will learn all about medical alert systems, and how to choose the best product for you while saving money.\r\n\r\n## Do You Need a Medical Alert System?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the aim of a medical alert system is to let people know if you should fall or suffer another kind of medical event. This could save your life if you are someone who is prone to falling.\r\n\r\nBut even if you are _not_ someone who suffers with mobility issues, it can still be a very good idea. You only need to fall _once_ to have a serious accident, and if you have a medical alert system on your person, then this could be the difference between life and death.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you shouldn’t think of this as something you invest in only once you start having trips and falls. Rather, you should think of it as something to invest in _before_ that begins happening. Once you start having trips and falls, it may well already be too late!\r\n\r\nThe other thing to consider is how this affects the people that you love. One of the things that many of us worry most about as we grow more dependent on others, is that we are going to be a burden. We therefore try to stubbornly fight the onslaught of age and refuse to make provisions to it.\r\n\r\nBut this actually _increases_ the burden on other people! Our loved ones worry about us when we are not there, and especially if there is any risk that we might fall or have a cardiac event. With that in mind, one of the best things we can do is to give them peace of mind with an alarm.\r\n\r\nNow, instead of feeling the need to call us every few minutes to make sure we’re okay, our loved ones can relax safe in the knowledge that if anything should happen, they will be automatically informed.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, you are actually doing the best thing for your loved ones by investing in these devices.\r\n\r\nBut you may also be concerned about the financial aspect, and knowing precisely what to buy. The rest of this post will help you to make the right decision.\r\n\r\n## How to Choose a Medical Alert System\r\n\r\nWhen buying a medical alert system there are a few things to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nA medical alert system can describe either a permanent installation in your home that uses a cord or a button. This is something you will then need to move toward and pull should you fall. Of course, this limits the usefulness of the solution, as you may fall and be too far away.\r\n\r\nOthers will allow you to carry them on your person, but will still require a landline meaning that they can’t leave the house. These work by giving you a small element that you can wear around your neck, and another aspect that you will plug into the landline.\r\n\r\nThese types of medical alert systems work well if you are someone who is house-bound. But if you are more mobile and you want to be able to leave the house to explore, then you should look into getting a cellular model that will work on its own.\r\n\r\nThe best of these will not only be able to contact people in an emergency if you fall – no matter where you are – but will also make a loud noise to alert people who are nearby. On top of that, some that are GPS enabled will be able to share your precise location.\r\n\r\n## More Features to Concern\r\n\r\nThere are many other features to consider on top of the mobility of your device. For example, it is very useful to have a battery test or battery indicator that can let you know when the device is running low. Without this seemingly minor feature, you may end up wearing a device that isn’t working – and be none the wiser.\r\n\r\nWater resistance is also an important feature. This will make the device more mobile by allowing you to wear it in the rain. At the same time, it means that you can wear the device in the shower or bath. This is of significant importance, seeing as a large number of slips actually happen in the shower in the first place.\r\n\r\nFinally, look for devices that provide health tracking sensors. For instance, if the device contains an electrocardiogram, then it will be able to tell you if you are having a heart attack. This in turn can be extremely useful for alerting the authorities early enough for them to be as effective as possible.\r\n\r\nOthers have fall detection, which can of course tell if you have fallen. Both these features prevent you from needing to actually press anything, which could once again be the difference between success and failure – life and death.\r\n\r\n## Finding Good Value Options\r\n\r\nBe on the lookout for so-called advanced models that don’t offer anything useful to the package. Aesthetics are not important for a device like this, but you _should_ spend the extra cash to get all of the features mentioned above – even if it is more expensive.\r\n\r\nLikewise, consider whether you need a medical team to be on the other end. Many of these devices come with a “plan” that will ensure there is someone on the other end of emergency calls to forward your messages to the relevant departments.\r\n\r\nWhile this can be useful, it does also risk tying you to a recurring fee that you may or may not be able to afford.\r\n\r\nThink carefully about whether you need this, as devices such as Guardian Alert 911 will give you direct access with a 911 operator and won’t incur any monthly cost.\r\n\r\nKeep this in mind, and choose a device based on the long-term cost, rather than the short-term investment.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nThere are few things more frightening, stressful, or life-life changing than a cancer diagnosis. And for men, prostate cancer is a particularly invasive and upsetting illness. It’s also a particularly common condition, affecting 191,930 men in the US last year alone<sup>1</sup>. This is the second most common cause of cancer in men, following skin cancer. Fortunately, it is also one of the most treatable.\r\n\r\nThe 5-year survival rate for men with prostate cancer discovered in the local or regional state (which accounts for 90% of cases) has a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. Those are exceptionally good odds. For those cases where the cancer has begun to spread to neighboring regions, this number falls to 30%.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Prostate-cancer.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the single most important factor when dealing with prostate cancer, is how quickly it is discovered. As long as the cancer is found before it has a chance to spread, then it can be effectively treated. This article will examine the nature of prostate cancer, and the treatment options.\r\n\r\n## What Causes Prostate Cancer\r\n\r\nTo best understand the prostate cancer treatment options, it is pertinent to understand what causes cancer and how it affects the body.\r\n\r\nEssentially, cancer is caused by mutations in DNA. The DNA is the genetic code housed in the nucleus of every single cell in your body. This code tells the cell how to behave and what to do, but it is also the “blueprint” that the body uses to create more cells like it. Over time, cells die and new ones form to take their place. This process occurs via something called mitosis: the division of one cell into two new identical ones.\r\n\r\nDuring mitosis, it is the DNA that is referred to by the body to ensure that each cell is the exact same and functions as it should. Problems occur however when DNA becomes damaged due to free radicals, radiation, age, or unknown factors. With faulty DNA, the body begins to make faulty copies of the cell. This is what we call a cancerous cell.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all of us have cancerous cells throughout our body. Fortunately, they are too few in number to cause any negative effects. Most of them will die with time, and we will continue to function normally and healthily.\r\n\r\nThe problems occur when those unhealthy cells split and divide again. And again. Gradually, this causes the cancer to spread and to form a legion. That legion eventually grows to the point where it constitutes a large amount of tissue taking up the organ. Once the tumor becomes too large, the organ stops functioning properly. Depending on where the tumor is located, this can result in a number of unwanted symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn the case of prostate cancer, this will typically include urgency, blood in the urine, weak urine flow, pain and burning during urination, and similar effects<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\n## How Prostate Cancer is Treated\r\n\r\nTreatments for prostate cancer then are centered around preventing the spread of cancerous cells. This can include removing the tumor, or targeting damaged cells with various procedures such as radiotherapy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the following treatments are the most commonly available:\r\n\r\n**Surgery:** Surgery is a prostate cancer treatment that is used simply to remove the tumor. This will involve removal of the entire prostate in most cases (radical open prostatectomy), which can risk damaging sexual function. Nerve-sparing surgery can be used to increase the chances of a man maintaining sexual function post-surgery. Other potential side effects include urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nOther surgery options are robotic or laparoscopic prostatectomy which uses a camera and instruments inserted through a keyhole incision. This can then be used to remove the prostate.\r\n\r\nTransurethral resection of the prostate involves surgery to relieve urinary blockage, though this won’t treat the cancer itself.\r\n\r\n**Radiation Therapy:** External beam radiation therapy is the most common type used to treat prostate cancer. This involves the use of x-rays applied to the area, which can destroy the cells. The concern with these x-rays is that they also destroy healthy cells, which can lead to a number of unwanted symptoms and a general feeling of being unwell among patients. However, a particular type of treatment called Conformal Radiation Therapy (CRT) can be used to minimize this damage to the surrounding healthy tissue and organs.\r\n\r\nAnother form of external beam radiation therapy is something called hypofractionated radiation therapy. This form uses higher doses, but over a shorter term. This has been found to be effective for those with early-stage prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nBrachytherapy is a more extensive treatment that involves the insertion of radioactive sources directly inside the damaged tissue (in this case the prostate). These sources are referred to as seeds and will release radiation in only that specific area. The amount of time they work for can depend on the precise nature of each seed however. They are left in the prostate indefinitely and may work for up to 1 year.\r\n\r\n**Chemotherapy:** Chemotherapy is a treatment that works similarly to radiotherapy, except that it uses chemicals rather than radiation in order to destroy the cancer cells. This also helps to reduce the growth rate of cancerous cells.\r\n\r\nChemotherapy is mostly used for advanced or castration-resistant prostate cancer and is not considered a first option. That’s because chemotherapy does not only affect the damaged prostate, but will affect the entire body. Also found to be effective, is to add testosterone suppression therapies to the chemotherapy, which can significantly lengthen lifespan.\r\n\r\n**Immunotherapy:** Immunotherapy is a form of treatment used specifically to boost the body’s own defenses against cancerous materials. This can be used in combination with other types of treatment.\r\n\r\nVaccine therapy uses sipuleucel-T, which is adapted to be unique for each patient. First, blood is removed from the patient via a process called leukapheresis. Special immune cells can then be removed from the blood and modified in the lab before being reinserted. The body will then have learned to recognize and destroy prostate cancer cells, if all goes to plan. Because this treatment does not lead to shrinking of the tumor, or lower PSA levels, it is difficult for physicians to monitor the progress and effectiveness of the treatment.\r\n\r\n**Other Treatments:** There are many other treatments available for treating prostate cancer, as well as treatments used to manage the symptoms and to control the side-effects of other treatments. These include bone modifying drugs for example, which can be used to help combat the weakening of bone in response to testosterone suppression. Radiopharmaceuticals can be used to treat castration resistant patients.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that often the treatment recommended will be “watchful waiting.” As the term suggests, this simply involves watching the patient’s progress and waiting for the right time to act.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Remedies\r\n\r\nAs well as many medical treatments, there are also alternative remedies for prostate cancer. These include the use of strong vitamin supplements, herbal remedies, light therapies, and homeopathy.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that supporting a healthy immune system with nutrients and vitamins can help to improve outcomes, it’s also extremely important to not to ignore the value of medical treatments: even where they might be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing with any form of cancer is to identify the issue as early as possible, and then to speak with your GP about treatment options.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nAs you get older and you begin to lose your health and mobility, it can be extremely difficult saying goodbye to your old freedom and independence. This is rarely felt stronger than when making “routine” trips to the shops. This basic human need is now something that often requires the assistance of others, and that can be a hair-raising experience even then. While many aspects of your independence may have been eroded, this is the part that stings the most in many cases.\r\n\r\nBut what defines your us is how we cope with adversity. And there are two ways you can react to this painful situation. Either, you can bask in the injustice of it all and stubbornly refuse to accept your current situation, or you can adapt and continue. If you choose to do the latter, then the next step for you is to invest in a mobility scooter.\r\n\r\n## ![](/posts/mobility-scooter-1372965_1920.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Mobility Scooter Basics\r\n\r\nA mobility scooter is essentially a small vehicle that can legally be driven on the pavement and often even around stores. This works a little like a wheelchair, but with a different purpose: to help you travel longer distances without manually propelling yourself around at every step.\r\n\r\nWhile you will still struggle with access and mobility in some areas: getting over stairs is impossible, and crowded sidewalks can be a nightmare; you will find that you now have the ability to travel much further than you previously could, and with no risk of falling and injuring yourself.\r\n\r\nBut of course, in order for this to be a successful purchase, you need to choose the _right_ mobility scooter for you.\r\n\r\nWith so many different options on the market, this can be a somewhat daunting and confusing process. Then there’s the slight issue of cost: as this is also a somewhat pricey investment given that you’re essentially buying a very small car!\r\n\r\nSo, what do you need to know?\r\n\r\n### Mobility and Practicality\r\n\r\nThe first thing to consider is the size of the model, as well as the top speed. While you might think that a faster model will be more liberating, the truth is that this can prevent you from being allowed on the pavement. For that reason, it’s important to ensure you do your research first, and find out what types of vehicles are permitted in your state or country. Conversely though, slower scooters may not be able to go on the road.\r\n\r\nIn some areas, scooters are divided into classes, with a “Class 2” scooter being treated different from a “Class 1” scooter.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is whether the scooter can fold into your trunk or not. Some scooters can be folded and stowed easily in a car, only to then be expanded once you arrive at your destination. This can greatly enhance the usability, as it means you can now visit other destinations and explore those areas.\r\n\r\nOf course, larger and more powerful scooters also often cost more: though this can also be greatly influenced by the inclusion of extra features (or the lack thereof).\r\n\r\nIf you do opt for a folding “trunk scooter,” then you should research just how easy it will be to handle that folding. If the folding requires a lot of effort and strength, then it might not be something you’re able to do on your own. The weight is also a factor at this point.\r\n\r\nIdeally, you want a scooter that can be easily lifted out of the trunk/boot and then assembled with one hand. That said, depending on your level of disability, it may be that you would be unable to assemble **any** scooter on your own. In that case, you may not consider this factor quite as strongly.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if your scooter is a trunk scooter that can be folded, then you might decide that you don’t need one fast enough to go on the road and vice versa. There is no single “right scooter,” the answer will depend very much on your intended use-cases and your current level of ability.\r\n\r\n## Other Considerations\r\n\r\nBefore investing lots of money into a scooter, it is highly important that you also research the max weight. The last thing you want to do, is to buy a scooter and then learn that it is unable to take your weight. Remember as well that you may wish to add shopping or other items to your load as well. Likewise, it is always possible that you may gain or lose weight over time.\r\n\r\n## How to Save Money on Scooters\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to getting a mobility scooter for less, there are a number of factors to consider.\r\n\r\nThe first, is that yes you can get a mobility scooter second hand! This means that you can save a lot of money versus buying one brand new, and there are very few downsides to choosing to go this route. While you should always put your safety first, a scooter is a durable investment that should be able to survive multiple owners. If you are concerned about the health of the device though, read the manual, check the history of owners, and consider getting it checked over by a mechanic.\r\n\r\nAnother point to bear in mind, is that you might be able to get financial help when choosing your scooter. This could come in the form of a grant, or perhaps a VAT or tax break. This is an investment you need to maintain your current quality of life, and with that in mind, it’s not simply a luxury. Governments, charities, and many other organizations should be able to help.\r\n\r\nRemember that a scooter is a little like a car in that it will require upkeep. That includes the occasional service, replacement parts, and more. This can cost more or less depending on the availability of said parts (an argument for getting a newer product), as well as the nature of the machine. Read reviews to ensure that the one you are investing in is relatively repairable. Ideally, you also want a scooter that isn’t prone to breaking down in the first place!\r\n\r\nFinally, think about fuel. Mobility scooters can be either gas or electric, and this is going to have a big impact on the running costs<sup>1</sup>. Electric scooters are not only more energy efficient, but they also let you charge them from home, thereby removing the need to spend money on fuel (this also helps you from a practical standpoint, and it’s good for the environment too). If you plan on driving your scooter on the road, you might find that gas is in some ways more convenient. But for the most part: choose electric.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nMedicare is a program that offers medical coverage for those over 65. This can cover a number of medical expenses, including hospital bills, prescription medications, and more. But while Medicare is a useful and important tool for looking after your health as you age, it is far from comprehensive. Importantly: it doesn’t cover the cost of dental care.\r\n\r\nWhile some people will tell you that dental care is covered by Medicare, the truth is that the majority of procedures, supplies, and services are not included in Medicare. This information comes direct from the official government Medicare website, so you shouldn’t trust sources that claim otherwise<sup>1</sup>.![](/posts/dental-medicare.jpg)\r\n\r\nThere are some exceptions to this rule however. The only medical services that are covered by Medicare Part A insurance are those that are carried out in hospital. This can include the removal of very difficult teeth (usually after a failed attempt by a dentist), oral surgeries for tumors and other issues spotted by dentists, and others. You pay 100% for non-covered services, so you should be prepared to pay for these services if you need them.\r\n\r\nIt’s also true that in some cases, certain Medicare Advantage Plans can include routine dental services. That means you’ll be able to visit the dentist and have your teeth checked. This _may_ also include certain procedures such as fillings and the removal of teeth, though you should read the fine print in your cover in order to ascertain this for certain.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are some circumstances in which Medicare may cover certain expenses relating to the cost of dental implants, such as the use of hospital transportation.\r\n\r\nIf you want dental cover then, the best thing to do is to look into private insurance from a third party. Medigap policies are designed specifically to offer the cover that is missing from a regular Medicare policy, but keep in mind that these often do not include dental services either.\r\n\r\nMore expensive premium health insurance may include dental insurance, but the better option is usually to consider getting separate cover for your teeth.\r\n\r\n## Dental Procedures to Consider\r\n\r\nAll this means that if you want a dental procedure, you will need to get separate dental insurance to cover those costs. So why might you need to do this? What kinds of procedures would be offered by dental insurance? Here are some examples of situations where dental insurance may be useful.\r\n\r\n**Your Teeth are Discolored:** Discolored teeth are another highly common complaint for people who want cosmetic dentistry, and this problem becomes more likely as you age. There are many ways to address this issue.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious way to make your teeth whiter is to have them cleaned professionally. Failing this, and if you need a more thorough job done, then you can have professional teeth whitening which will ‘paint’ your teeth with a coating that will make your teeth appear much cleaner and whiter. It’s also possible to have your teeth bleached which again can make them almost shine.\r\n\r\nFinally, veneers can also be used to make your teeth white as well as a straighter. Because you are covering your teeth with ceramic, they will look however white that façade is. You choose the color of your veneers and that will be the whiteness of your new teeth (a word of caution: don’t go too white!) The same is also true of dental crowns, which will fit over the top of your old teeth and make them look whiter from every angle. An added bonus of dental crowns _or_ veneers is that they also protect teeth from future problems by acting like a sheath.\r\n\r\n**You Have Fillings or Abscesses:** Dentistry shouldn’t just address the issue of how your mouth looks when you’re smiling, but also how it looks when it’s opened. If you open your mouth to laugh or speak and you reveal flashes of black or silver – whether its abscesses or fillings – this can be quite unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThis is once again a more common issue for the older population, seeing as the technology used for fillings has come a long way.\r\n\r\nThere are a range of procedures to help this problem. For example, it is possible to get white fillings to replace your silver ones which will be matched to the color of your real teeth. This way, it won’t be obvious that you’ve had work done and your whole smile will be white. This can also help solve the problem of abscesses, and if you haven’t already had fillings (perhaps for fear of a metal mouth) then this is a good option to quickly make the inside of your mouth more attractive. Finally, dental crowns can be used to cap off the top of your teeth as well as the fronts and sides. In this sense dental crowns are much like veneers except in that they cover the teeth from every angle ensuring that they look great when you smile _and_ when you open your mouth.\r\n\r\n**Your Teeth Are Broken:** If your teeth are chipped or broken then this will cause the same unappealing look as either crooked or missing teeth. This can also present a health issue, as it might cause your teeth to scratch on the inside of your mouth and cause irritation.\r\n\r\nFortunately, many of the same techniques can be used to repair broken teeth. For instance, dental crowns can be used to completely cover a broken tooth, while veneers can be attached to the outside to cover up the chip from the front. It is also possible to have your teeth glued so that you have a fake replacement attached where you have tooth missing.\r\n\r\n**Your Jaw is Misaligned:** Lastly, some people will find that their jaws look misaligned and they this way end up with an overbite or a protruding lower jaw. This can also mean that the teeth don’t fit together when they close their mouths thereby resulting in a smile that looks “gappy” or forced. Other related issues include snoring, difficulty eating, and TMJ. To solve this problem, you should get surgery for your jaw which can change the shape and position of it bringing either the top or bottom jaw forward or bringing it back.\r\n\r\nThere are many more dental procedures that can improve your health, your appearance, and your quality of life – and many of these are particularly useful as you get older. Seeing as these procedures aren’t covered by Medicare, it’s highly advisable you look into additional cover.\r\n\r\n1. [Medicare.gov](https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/dental-services)\r\n"

That’s where tax prep can make all the difference, and it’s why many people benefit from using a tax prep service to help get their paperwork in order.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for tax prep to help you plan and save, there are a variety of new services and tax prep tools that have been released this year that makes filing even easier!\r\n\r\n## Tax Explained\r\n\r\nFor those that are new to paying tax, it’s important to understand the fundamentals of what it involves. Essentially, your job is to report on your profit for the year, which is different from your revenue or turnover. While turnover refers to the amount of money that passed _through_ your business, profit refers to the amount of money that you were actually able to keep personally, or to invest back into your company.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you were selling a handmade piece of art that cost $20, and you managed to sell 4,000 units over the course of the year, your _turnover_ would be $80,000… not bad!\r\n\r\nBut if each one of those items cost you $10 to make (because it was made from expensive materials), and $2 to package and send, then your profit would actually only be $8 per unit. That’s a yearly profit of $32,000. Now if you are also renting an office for $15,000 for the year, and spending $2,500 on bills, your overall profit is actually just $14,500. THIS is the amount that would be taxed, and not the turnover that you made each year<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, what information do you need to collect as you are running your business?\r\n\r\nThe cost of the materials and the rent will thus be “written off,” meaning that they won’t be included in your tax calculation (though this doesn’t mean you will “get” any additional money for it, which is what some people seem to believe!).\r\n\r\n### Information to Collect\r\n\r\nTo begin your tax prep, you therefore need:\r\n\r\n- A total tally of ALL the money that was paid into your business over the course of the year\r\n- A list of all the individual expenses that your business paid\r\n  - This includes one-off purchases\r\n  - As well as ongoing fees, bills, and debt\r\n    - In some cases, a company may still be paying off initial debt that was required to get the business up and running. This in turn can\r\n\r\nIn order to write something off against your tax, you need to be able to prove that you spent that money. In other words then, you can’t claim something as tax deductible if you don’t have a receipt or a similar proof of purchase.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the biggest jobs involved in tax prep: collecting and organizing receipts and invoices!\r\n\r\nLikewise, you should also be able to provide evidence of your income that the IRS can use in order to check where the money has come from. That means you should have invoices for any clients you billed, and copies of receipts for products you purchased.\r\n\r\nA good piece of advice is to try and enter all of this data into a spreadsheet of some sort. You can this way keep a tally of everything that has come into the business, and all the money you have spent. That then allows you to run quick sums to find out the totals.\r\n\r\nSome other things to consider:\r\n\r\n- Capital gains: money that your business\r\n- Loans and fees that you may be paying back\r\n- Interest earned from investments and savings accounts\r\n\r\n## What Does a Tax Preparer Do? And Do You Need One?\r\n\r\nThe job of a tax preparer then is to help an individual or business to go through their paperwork and documents, in order to pull out the relevant information. They can help to provide you with a calculation early on (which prepares you for the amount you need to pay), and to ensure that you have all the documents you are legally required to present in case of an audit.\r\n\r\nTax preparers will also be able to handle the actual process of filing the tax returns and entering the data online/via post. This can save you a considerable amount of time and stress.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, is that a good tax preparer should be able to save you money: and in most cases you’ll save more money that you will spend on the preparer. This is because tax preparers have far greater familiarity with the tax system, and therefore know precisely what can and can’t be claimed. This means you’ll be able to save more money and pay less back.\r\n\r\n**Do You Need a Tax Preparer?**\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question will largely hinge on the type of business that you are running, as well as your confidence in dealing with financial matters.\r\n\r\nFor some businesses, tax is actually a very straightforward matter. If you run a service-based business (perhaps you offer writing for instance) and you are a sole proprietor, then your accounting will largely be a matter of logging how much work you have done and thus how much payment you have received. From there, you’ll simply need to list a few minor expenses: such as the cost of a new computer every few years, and some of your electrical bills. There’s a high likelihood that a tax preparer can still save you money by finding more opportunities to write off expenses, and could potentially save you trouble by ensuring that all of your books are up-to-date and to satisfactory standards. If you ever get audited, you will be more than happy that you got a tax preparer to help! That said, this is still not a “must have” in that most people should be able to understand and formulate their tax returns.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you run a limited business or even an incorporated business, then you will have a far more complex tax return to fill out. Likewise, if you run a business that sells a product with lots of expenses and overheads, then the sheer time commitment involved might necessitate a tax preparer.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that any time you spend filing and organizing taxes is time you have taken out of your business: time that you could have spent providing value to your customers and clients.\r\n\r\n**Tax Preparer vs Accountants**\r\n\r\nEither a tax prepare or an accountant can handle tax prep for businesses and individuals. The key difference is that a tax preparer specializes in tax prep, whereas an accountant will provide a range of additional services, usually over a long-term arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the IRS requires service provides to pass an examination demonstrating their competency preparing 1040 tax returns<sup>2</sup>.\r\n\r\nWhatever you decide, the main takeaway is that you should aim to be as organized and prepared as possible for the next tax return. You’ll save money, time, and significant headache!\r\n\r\n1. [How to start an online business as a freelancer](https://savumin.com/start-an-online-business/)\r\n2.

      "content": "\r\nLooking for a way to upgrade your home? Investing in better home security systems is very often the best use of your capital and a great way to ensure that your property will be safe from intruders and that you won’t lose your belongings to theft or vandalism.\r\n\r\nThere are many big advantages to upgrading home security but the most important one is that it can help you and your family to sleep easier at night – which is worth any amount of money. And from a financial standpoint, this can also be a great way to _save_ money on costly repairs, insurance, or replacing your belongings.\r\n\r\nThe best part is that it doesn’t have to cost the Earth to begin with either. Here are some of the best home security features and how to get each one at a fair price.\r\n\r\n## Security Cameras Systems\r\n\r\nNot every home makes use of security cameras systems but these days this is a great investment that can keep your home much safer. With home security cameras you’ll not only be able to keep your property under surveillance. This not only deters potential trespassers by signaling that you have home security systems in place, but also ensures that you are filming if anyone _should_ break and enter so that you have evidence that you can provide the police with in their investigation.\r\n\r\nHome CCTV systems these days are far more advanced and practical than they were in the past. These days the best CCTV is a wireless security camera system which means your cameras won’t need to be wired to a computer or even the mains. This means you no longer have any restriction when choosing where to place your cameras and means you can move them whenever you want to. This is a very useful advantage because otherwise simply moving around some of your furniture can block the view you previously had.\r\n\r\nWireless security cameras also have the advantage of allowing you to stream the footage anywhere in the world. This means that if you’re on holiday with your family, you can log onto the local Wi-Fi and check on your home using your wireless home security cameras. This is a great feeling and is much more reassuring than simply relying on your neighbors to hear an alarm. Some CCTV systems even go so far as to allow you to control the angle of the camera or speak through it. If you want that latter feature, then look for ‘VoIP CCTV’.\r\n\r\n**How to Save**\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that you don’t necessarily need an expensive camera installation for your home security systems. Nanny cams with VoIP and Wi-Fi are common and affordable, while you can get lots of smaller webcam devices that work well with Google Home or Alexa.\r\n\r\nAnother tip? If you don’t have the money for an exterior cam, then you can always use a dummy camera! This won’t actually collect any footage, but it can act as a great deterrent<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\n## Home Alarm Systems\r\n\r\nJust as important are home alarm systems, which these days work best when integrated with your CCTV. Your home alarm system should be able to detect when someone breaks into any window or door in your house and then should sound the alarm to scare away trespassers, to attract the attention of neighbors and others in the area and to generally draw attention to what’s happening.\r\n\r\nMore advanced home alarm systems these days can also alert _you_ to the problem by either calling you or letting you know by text. These kinds of alerts should also allow you to turn off the system if it’s a false alarm.\r\n\r\nBy linking your home alarm systems to your CCTV you can take advantage of video analysis and motion sensors in order to detect unusual movement around your house. This way you can sound the alarm only when your cameras pick up a person moving around your home – which is of course just when you would most _want_ the alarms to be sounded.\r\n\r\nHome alarm systems also let you set up protocols for contacting the police or a home security agency. This way, those organizations can then respond to the problem on your behalf – ensuring that your property is always fully protected even when you’re away.\r\n\r\n**Saving**\r\n\r\nAgain, one of the best ways to afford a good home alarm system that will sync with your CCTV is to look into smart home solutions. Another option is Alexa Guard. While this won’t work as well as a genuine alarm, it will detect ambient noises in your home and then alert you to that fact. This works using _only_ an Echo or Echo Dot, meaning you can get it set up for $30 or less if you look out for a deal!<sup>2</sup>\r\n\r\n## Locks\r\n\r\nA little more low-tech but no less important is to make sure that you have secure locks installed on your doors and windows that can’t easily by bypassed with a set of lockpicks. Investing a little more in your locks can make a big difference and the same goes for your front gates and the padlock you have on them.\r\n\r\nHaving a large padlock can actually make a big difference to your home security which is for one very big and important reason: deterrence. You want to communicate to any potential criminals that you _care_ about your home security and have invested in it. If they see a large padlock on an iron gate then normally they will move on to easier targets. Remember: the majority of crimes are actually crimes of opportunity.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go one step more advanced, then you can even look into getting a digital lock. Digital locks work by requiring either a pin code or even biometric data (such as a finger print or retinal scan) in order to control access. This is a very useful tool because it means that your lock can’t be picked and you don’t have to worry if you lose your keys or if you’ve moved house!\r\n\r\n**Saving**\r\n\r\nThere is no real way to save money on a good lock. The most important thing is simply to remember that this is going to save you money in the long term, by keeping your belongings safe. The other thing to remember is that you can actually save money on your insurance by investing in better locks. Even if this isn’t advertising, try giving them a call and see if they will consider lowering your rates. The same goes for all your home security systems!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nMost of us spend a lot of money on our phone bills, but don’t see any way to untether ourselves. These days, communication is constant and fundamental to our personal and business lives, and people expect to be able to get hold of us 24/7.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1200x628_voip_zoomonnumbers.jpg)\r\n\r\nBut what if I told you there was a way to be just as available, while drastically lowering the amount you spend on your phone bill each month? The answer is VoIP or “Voice over Internet Protocol.” This basically means that you will be using WiFi to make calls instead of your phone plan, which in turn can save you a lot of money – especially when calling abroad.\r\n\r\nSo how can you cut your phone cord and start saving serious cash using VoIP? This post will explain everything you need to know.\r\n\r\n## Using Your Phone Plan Less\r\n\r\nThe first and most straightforward way to start costing yourself less on your mobile phone bill, is to avoid making calls using it whenever possible. In other words, when you have the opportunity to call over WiFi (whenever you have a good WiFi connection), you should do so.\r\n\r\nThere are many different apps you can use to call this way, ranging from Skype, to Facetime, to Slack, to WhatsApp. As long as you have at least a moderate signal on 3G, you will be able to chat with minimal lag.\r\n\r\nSo how does calling this way reduce the amount you pay? Of course it doesn’t, seeing as a lot of people will pay monthly! So the solution then is to switch back to a pay-as-you-go plan. That way, you will only pay for the minutes that you use!\r\n\r\nAnd of course whatever deal you’re on, this will save you money when making calls overseas.\r\n\r\nAnother option, is to switch to a plan with very few minutes and then to make calls using VoIP.\r\n\r\nOf course, most people these days will use iMessage or WhatsApp to send their messages instead of SMS, which can likewise save a lot of money – especially when it comes to sending images.\r\n\r\n## Using Your Mobile Data\r\n\r\nEVEN if you use your 3G connection rather than WiFi – which of course you also pay for – you’ll still save money by using VoIP.\r\n\r\nThat’s because the audio files that transmit your voice are actually only very small. On average, you’ll only use a megabyte of data per minute of conversation. Now if you consider that there are 1,000 megabytes in a gigabyte, and that a very basic plan might give you 3GB… that’s 50 hours of talk time probably less than $10 per month!<sup>1</sup>\r\n\r\n## Combined Plans\r\n\r\nWith more and more people choosing to use VoIP as a way to save on their monthly plans, it was only a matter of time until some companies started offering this as the de-facto service.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you choose to use Google Fi as your carrier, then you will find that you save a lot of money by using that method precisely.\r\n\r\nGoogle Fi is Google’s first serious attempt at running a carrier business, and it is leveraging its considerable influence and tech savvy to offer something a bit different. Fi works essentially by switching users between different carriers to make sure they remain on the fastest signal at all times<sup>2</sup>. Specifically, Google Fi can “piggyback” off of three separate networks: Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this all the more impressive though, is that Google Fi will usually opt to route you through WiFi using VoIP instead. This can _significantly_ reduce your bills if you spend a lot of tie in the home or in the office.\r\n\r\nGoogle Fi doesn’t support all devices, but does work on most major handsets.\r\n\r\n## Closing Comments\r\n\r\nWhatever you decide, the point is that VoIP now offers a very viable alternative to using your usual cellular data. This can save you a lot of money as only a small amount of data is needed, and especially if you rely mostly on the WiFi you already pay for (or your boss already pays for!). You can even use VoIP when speaking in cafés and other locations!\r\n\r\nThe best part is that as data is constantly getting cheaper and cheaper, and we might even see _free_ internet around the world someday<sup>3</sup>, this is only likely to become an increasingly affordable option in future.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, you should consider switching to VoIP calls when you can. And next time you are renewing your contract, think twice about paying more for all those minutes and texts. You may not need them!\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nHealth scams are a particularly unscrupulous form of con. These prey on our desire to feel and look our best, and in many cases even go after those of us suffering with serious illnesses.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that people are so ready to believe alternative cures and “weird tricks,” at the same time as dismissing the advice from their healthcare professionals. The human desire for an easy fix – especially during the hardest times – is an extremely strong drive. And where there’s a powerful human impulse, there are people rubbing their hands together ready to make money from us.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we’re going to break down some of the worst health fads and scams that people are still putting their hopes on – and why they’re ineffectual.\r\n\r\n## Workouts That “Target Stomach Fat”\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple example of how we can be misled about our health. There are hundreds of thousands or workout programs, books, and YouTubers that promise they can help us to “burn” stomach fat.\r\n\r\nThe truth? They either don’t know what they’re talking about, or they’re willfully lying. It’s unclear which is worse!\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is no such thing as targeted fat loss. That is to say that you will lose fat equally all around your body, and there is no way to “direct it” toward a specific area. If you try and lose belly fat, the first thing that goes may be your booty! The precise order in which you lose fat is actually determined genetically, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do to control it.\r\n\r\nWhat you _can_ do is to strengthen the stomach muscles – including the transverse abdominis – which can add to a flatter and stronger appearance.\r\n\r\n## Hopi Candling\r\n\r\nHopi candling is an extremely strange phenomenon that involves standing candles in your ears. Yep, you heard right! Often with these health scams and fads, it’s a case of the “stranger the better.”\r\n\r\nThe difference is that the candle is hollow, and this then creates a vacuum. As the fire at the end gobbles up all the oxygen, this creates a pressure gradient, which causes air to be sucked through your ears. It feels as odd as you might imagine it would!\r\n\r\nWhy would you want to suck through your ear? As is so often the case, the aim here is to “detox” the body. And advocates will point to the fact that the candle fills with black discharge as proof of this action.\r\n\r\nBut it turns out that the black substance is not caused by toxins. In fact, a 2007 study published in the American Family Physician<sup>1</sup> showed that ear candling had no beneficial effect and may even cause “more harm than good.” That black discharge? Well that was actually candle wax and soot caused by the candle!\r\n\r\nPhysicians also noted that some patients showed signs of local burning and tympanic membrane perforation, while the process also posed a very real fire hazard!\r\n\r\n## Charcoal in Coffee\r\n\r\nPutting charcoal in your coffee has been a very popular trend for a while now. The idea is that the activated charcoal will help to remove toxins, heavy metals, pollutants, and contaminants from your hot beverages. This in turn works because activated charcoal is porous and contains huge distances of tunnels within its surface. This makes it effective at absorbing bacteria and pollutants, which is why one of the best things you can do if you think you may have ingested some kind of poison is to consume activated charcoal straight after.\r\n\r\nSo put it in your coffee… makes sense right?\r\n\r\nSure, except the problem is that putting activated charcoal in your coffee will only absorb any toxins or pollutants that happen to be in your stomach at the time. There’s no way that activated charcoal can reach into your bloodstream or brain to remove harmful substances!\r\n\r\nSeeing as most people won’t have consumed anything poisonous along with their coffee, this is largely unhelpful. What’s more, is that activated charcoal _can_ still go ahead and absorb all the beneficial nutrients from your stomach! If you have enough activated charcoal, this could even lead to a nutrient deficiency.\r\n\r\nAfter all, charcoal does not know the difference between a germ and a friendly bacterium, nor does it know the difference between mercury and potassium.\r\n\r\n## Detoxing\r\n\r\nEvery health site and blogger it seems is currently promoting the virtues of detoxing. Detoxing is, allegedly, a great way to remove toxins and harmful agents from your body and to that way improve your health across the board. The argument is that the foods we consume contain harmful heavy metals and that these can cause us serious damage over time; leading us to feel sluggish, tired and depressive; and potentially eventually leading to more serious health problems.\r\n\r\nBut the word detox is something that has been a little overused and over-marketed. In fact, there is actually no clear consensus as to what constitutes a detox or why we should ever need to detox in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in one study, it was shown that many manufacturers of products such as shampoos claiming to be toxin free, could not actually explain what toxins they were free of! Likewise, many detoxing products could not provide any sensible explanation as to what they were detoxing or how it was of any benefit to users.\r\n\r\nIn reality, our bodies are equipped with all the tools and systems they need to detox naturally – with no intervention from any detoxing shampoos or worrying laxative treatments.\r\n\r\nThis has led to many writers and scientists making the statement that detoxing is a myth and that it ultimately amounts to little more than a marketing stunt designed to part us with our money in exchange for no tangible benefit.\r\n\r\nIs detoxing really a myth and should we avoid all products with the word ‘detox’ on the front going forward?\r\n\r\nIf only it were that simple. A quick search of Google will show you that this is an argument that is alive and well with a lot of persuasive points on both sides. As one Huffington Post article points out<sup>2</sup>, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) conducted a study that discovered 212 chemicals in participants’ blood and urine that shouldn’t be there. These included the likes of acrylamide (the result of baking foods at high temperatures, also a byproduct of cigarette smoke), arsenic, bicephenol A (found in plastics, food packaging etc.), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs – found in paints and air fresheners) and more.\r\n\r\nTogether, these toxins have the potential to build up and place a serious strain on your body and general health. Then there are the heavy metals that do indeed exist in a lot of foods – just look at the mercury that is found in tuna for example! Mercury poisoning is incredibly dangerous and can lead to permanent damage of the nervous system, which is why a detox is necessary for those that have overindulged in tuna or swordfish…\r\n\r\nLikewise, it’s possible for toxins to build up in the skin. This is why pores become clogged and it’s why we end up getting spots.\r\n\r\nBut that likewise doesn’t mean that a detoxing shampoo is going to help you, nor will many of the other products on the market that don’t really understand what the term actually means. It also doesn’t mean that something like a coffee irrigation (which involves using coffee anally) is going to be beneficial. In fact, this is more likely to cause dehydration and numerous other problems.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the problem is not with detoxing itself but rather with the way that many companies and bloggers have mishandled the concept. What’s important for you, is that you know how to tell the difference between a genuine detoxifying product or strategy, and one that is just a waste of money.\r\n\r\nThe best advice? Speak with your physician.\r\n\r\n## Homeopathy\r\n\r\nThis will likely upset some people, but the truth is that homeopathy is a parasitic industry that is among the worst culprit when it comes to “preying on the desperate.”\r\n\r\nFor those that haven’t done their research, homeopathy might seem like a harmless trend toward holistic, natural treatments. There is nothing wrong with choosing natural remedies over drugs for minor complaints, so long as you seek advice from your physician.\r\n\r\nHomeopathy is something entirely different.\r\n\r\nHomeopathy basically is based around the theory that a treatment should cause the same symptoms as the condition it’s trying to cure. So in other words: if you wanted to cure yourself from a cold, a homeopathic remedy would be one that caused your nose to run and caused you to sneeze. The inventor of homeopathy – Samuel Hahnemann – believed that this would encourage the body to fight the _original_ cause of the problem<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nThe only problem with this is that it’s arbitrary: someone just made that idea up thinking it sounded somewhat logical. Of course when people started administering these cures it was then found that the patients ended up getting more ill and often died.\r\n\r\nSo instead of admitting defeat, homeopaths decided to dilute their ingredients with water, sugar and alcohol to such a degree that the medication barely included _any_ of that original substance. In many cases, this is done to such an extent that actually _none_ of the original substance is left in the mixture at al. So in other words you’re paying tons of money just to get a pot of water and sugar. Still think your _doctor_ is the one trying to rip you off?\r\n\r\nPromoters of homeopathy claim that even though the original active agent often isn’t included in the product, the “life force” of the substance has been transferred to the water. Of course there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that such a life force exists – and it certainly doesn’t exist in bits of herb that have been arbitrarily chosen to cure a laundry list of diseases.\r\n\r\nOf course there are absolutely no studies that demonstrate that homeopathic remedies work _at all_ – though there are plenty that demonstrate it doesn’t.\r\n\r\nWhat makes homeopathy so dangerous and so despicable is that it claims to be a valid treatment for serious, life-threatening illnesses such as cancer. Many homeopaths will recommend that sufferers _avoid_ radiotherapy and chemotherapy and instead trust 100% in their pot of water.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate fact of the matter is that this significantly lessens their chance of survival.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\nStudying social work gives you the opportunity to make a genuine and positive impact on the lives of people and communities. It’s also a fascinating course that will provide you with a range of amazing and in-demand skills. You’ll find plenty of great employment opportunities lining up, and you’ll earn a healthy salary.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/Social-work-1024x681.jpg)Let’s take a look at the benefits of an online social work degree, what it involves, and whether it is right for you.\r\n\r\n## What You Will Learn\r\n\r\nMany people are attracted to social work degrees because they like the idea of helping people and communities and having a positive impact. Social work is about helping the lives of people by listening to their needs and supporting them where necessary.\r\n\r\nOn a typical social work course, you can expect to learn the following subjects:\r\n\r\n**Social Service Delivery Systems**: You’ll spend around 40 hours of volunteer social work, while also learning about the role of the federal state, and organizations in providing social care.\r\n\r\n**Foundations of Social Work Practice**: This will teach you the theoretical foundations and skills that underpin social work.\r\n\r\n**Micro Human Behavior in the Social Environmen**t: This explores human behavior in the social environment, helping students to better understand and anticipate the actions of others.\r\n\r\n**Social Work Practice**: Here you will learn a number of skills and practices such as cross-cultural interviewing, communication patterns, case-recording and more. These skills will be of paramount importance once you are working as a social worker.\r\n\r\n**Research Methods**: This is the application of the scientific method to the collection and appraisal of qualitative and quantities data. In other words, it allows you to collect data in an efficient manner in order to paint an accurate picture of social welfare.\r\n\r\n- Statistics\r\n- Macro human behavior in the social environment\r\n- Diversity and oppression in a social work context\r\n- And more.\r\n\r\nOther topics include:\r\n\r\nA typical undergraduate bachelor’s degree program will take around 4 years to complete. However, accelerated courses, and part-time learning options are available for those that are interested.\r\n\r\nThere are some compelling reasons to consider social work as a career:\r\n\r\n- Starting salaries are strong. Average social work salaries range from $40K to $65K<sup>1</sup>, depending on location and specialist field.\r\n- Every day is different and challenging.\r\n- It is highly rewarding.\r\n- The jobs market is growing.\r\n\r\nThe student will also learn many skills that can be applied to everyday life, helping to build more sympathetic, open-minded, and well-rounded people. You will learn about ethics and values, self-awareness, service delivery, language diversity, leadership, diversity, advocacy, and much more.\r\n\r\nAs with any degree, a bachelor’s in social work can help you when applying to office jobs and other positions too. This course demonstrates determination, initiative, communication skills, critical thinking, and more.\r\n\r\n## Choosing the Right Program\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between an associate’s degree (AA) and a bachelor’s degree (BA). An associate’s degree is a shorter and less comprehensive qualification. While this will cost less, it will also result in a more limited range of career opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe more common option is the four-year Bachelor of Social Work degree (BSW) which is the base requirement for many social work positions<sup>2</sup>. This prepares students for a range of positions.\r\n\r\nThe right online bachelor’s in social work should be accredited. To qualify, the program must also include at least 400 hours of supervised field experience. That means that even when a program is online, it will still require a lot of in-person learning, and this is something to factor into your decision process when choosing whether you have the flexibility to support such a program.\r\n\r\n## Career Prospects\r\n\r\nWith a social work degree, you’ll be considered suitable for the following types of work:\r\n\r\n- Case consultant for evaluation and recommendation of individuals with special requirements\r\n- Child life specialist\r\n- Court-appointed special advocate\r\n- Criminal justice social worker\r\n- Gerontology social worker\r\n- Child protective services worker\r\n\r\nThe course can also be useful for those interested in working as counselors, in schools, or even in politics/local government.\r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\n\r\nIf you like the thought of helping others, and you are fascinated in sociology and psychology, then a social work degree is one of the best options to quickly start putting that knowledge to good use. To become a clinical psychologist will require years of training **following** an undergraduate and master’s degree. Social work provides a practical and fascinating guide to helping the people in our community who need it most. And now that this type of training is available online, anyone can do it!\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in getting started, check out these sponsored links for some amazing opportunities.\r\n\r\n1.

      "content": "\r\n## ATM Fees\r\n\r\nWant to save cash on your cruise? One of the best ways to do that is to ditch all the crazy ATM fees! Nobody likes paying money just to access their money. So how do you avoid this? Grab your cash on the shore when you make port. Use a local bank ATM. You’ll save all sorts of cash!\r\n\r\n## Movies on Demand\r\n\r\nWatching a movie in your room sure does add up. These things on average set you back at least $10. With so much to do on a cruise, do you really want to drop more cash on a movie? If you think you might need some movies to kill time on extended time on the water, download a few before leaving. Or in reality, take advantage of the activities taking place on the boat.\r\n\r\n## Cruise Certification\r\n\r\nDid you love your cruise? Think you’ll likely go again? If so, purchase your cruise certification before leaving. It’ll save you money in the future.\r\n\r\n## Not Buying the Drink and Food Cards\r\n\r\nMuch like the ATMs, when there’s no place to go, you have to use what is on board. Food and drink is one of the great offerings on a cruise, unless you don’t have a food and drink card. This really adds up when buying per meal or per drink. Whether you go with the all inclusive cards or spring for the discount cards running $40 or so, you’ll save far more with the card than trying to pay by the meal.\r\n\r\n## Spa Goods\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the spa services on a cruise is great. However, right after the massage or facial you’ll be asked to purchase a set of spa products. These are extremely overpriced. You’ll probably end up overpaying three fold for these items. So skip the added spa goods.\r\n\r\n## Casino\r\n\r\nThere are some games for skilled players, like poker or blackjack. Then there are other games designed to just rip you off. This is even more so on a cruise than at a casino because with a casino there are other places to go. So skip the casino “luck” games unless you want to give away your money.\r\n\r\n## Pull Tabs\r\n\r\nThese are kind of like raffle tickets you buy before a show. It also has worse odds than most casino games. So just opt out of this.\r\n\r\n## Understand Sail Cards\r\n\r\nYou might attend a seminar on the cruise and take some products you think are free, only to be charged for them later. Read the sail cards and signage before taking part in any of these events.\r\n\r\n## Cell Phones\r\n\r\nYou’re over international waters, which means you’ll be charged hefty cell phone fees. So turn off data roaming. Nothing like opening up your cell phone bill and seeing that giant roaming charge. So ditch this and save the cash!\r\n\r\n## Shore Excursions\r\n\r\nDon’t book your shore excursions with the cruise. You’ll be well overcharged. Instead, do a bit of research ahead of time and book with a company on land.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## Lack of Planning\r\n\r\nIt’s impossible to know the future, but it is possible to have several plans in place to deal with things as they come. Generally, having some money in savings can make dealing with life’s minor and major disasters a lot more manageable. Rich people often don’t just have fewer problems in their lives, they’re just better able to deal with them better. That means they have an emergency fund in place, they’re saving for their retirement, and they have insurance that covers their major assets.\r\n\r\n## Not Updating Your Financial Plan\r\n\r\nThey also frequently update their plans so that they are prepared to deal with expenses such as car repairs or college tuition. When unexpected money comes in, they will save it until it is needed rather than spend it right away.\r\n\r\n## Relying too Heavily on Credit Cards\r\n\r\nIf you frequently rely on credit cards because you can’t afford to buy things with the cash you have available, then you’re going to have a hard time building wealth. Managing your spending is one of the first things that you have to learn if you have any hope of becoming rich.\r\n\r\n## Not Creating a Budget\r\n\r\nDevelop a budget and spending plan that has you paying off bills within your means. Stick to it, and soon you’ll be able to put money into a savings account instead of spending it on repaying loans.\r\n\r\n## Spending More Than Your Income\r\n\r\nIf it seems like you never have enough money after paying your bills, then you have to start making cutbacks in your lifestyle. This won’t be easy; people who have built wealth have had to sacrifice a lot more than a cable tv subscription. Expect to live in smaller house and drive an older car than many of your peers. If you can have money left over the day before you get your next paycheck, however, you’re on the path to building your financial future.\r\n\r\n## Bad Investing\r\n\r\nMost of the mistakes that people make when it comes to investing involve either putting their money into something they didn’t understand, following the crowd into a popular investment, and/or choosing investments that are inconsistent with their goals. The best way to avoid these issues is to learn as much as you can about potential investments and keep your portfolio simple. Start by identifying your goals; do you want to save for retirement, save for a house, or get out of debt?\r\n\r\n## Not Creating Investment Timelines\r\n\r\nBase your investment timeline on this goal. From there, choose assets that match with your timeline, goals, and risk tolerance. Choose CDs and government bonds for short-term investments with money that you can’t afford to lose, stock funds for medium-term investments that need to grow quickly, and consider a combination of these items for long-term goals such as retirement or college savings.\r\n\r\n## You Don’t Think You Can Do It\r\n\r\nChanting “I believe in me” won’t get you rich, but believing that anything you try is doomed from the start is a guaranteed way to ensure that you’ll be poor for the rest of your life. People who believe they can’t stick to a budget or save money will discover that they really can’t; something will always come up in life that will “require” them to spend money. On the other hand, people who start with even the smallest amount of money and the will to save will discover that life will get a little bit easier as they save. Even $100 in a checking account is enough to protect you from bounced check fees. Saving $500 can cover most insurance deductibles or pay for a small car repair.\r\n\r\n## You want to help everyone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you start to collect even a small amount of wealth, friends and family members will try to get it from you. While some of these people may be in desperate need of help, many of them simply want you to solve their problems for them. Giving away your savings to everyone who made bad decisions and can’t pay their rent or fix their car means that you’re constantly starting back at zero.\r\n\r\n## Not Organizing Your Savings Donations\r\n\r\nIf you want to help, budget a set amount of money each month as charity. Keep this money in a separate account if you have to, and let it accumulate in months when no one is asking for your help. When someone comes along with a problem that you can’t say no to, give them only the money in this fund. That way, you can still help, but their problems won’t drag you down as well. On a similar subject, also avoid getting into joint loan applications or co-signing for people as a way to help them. This is one of the quickest ways to lose your savings over someone else’s bad decisions.\r\n"

Compound interest takes a while to work, but it’s the best way to make a small, safe, and reasonable investment pay off. Just make sure that you pick a stable, relatively low-risk investment, such as bonds or a mutual fund.\r\n\r\n### Invest small amounts over time\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3764\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3764\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 invest over time small investor](/posts/2-invest-over-time-small-investor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3764\">[Tzido_sun](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-298778966/stock-photo-hand-putting-mix-coins-and-seed-in-clear-bottle-on-cityscape-photo-blurred-cityscape-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you only have a few dollars a week to invest, pick investments that will grow over time. Purchasing a small amount of a stock or mutual fund every week ensures that you’ll be purchasing a lot of stock when prices are low, and less stock when prices are high. This strategy ensures that you’ll get the maximum possible return on your money.\r\n\r\n### Pick low-fee investments\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3765\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3765\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 small fee small investor](/posts/3-small-fee-small-investor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3765\">[Jakub Krechowicz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-392380090/stock-photo-greed-for-money-hands-grabbing-coins.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest things that can hurt small investors are the fees charged by brokerages. High percentage fees can eat away at the value of your money over time. Because brokers take their fees whether your account is up or down, it’s next to impossible to get ahead over a long period of time. Look for investments that offer fees of less than 1% over time.\r\n\r\n### Consider your risk carefully\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3766\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3766\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 risk small investor](/posts/4-risk-small-investor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3766\">[who_is_danny](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-396781918/stock-photo-risk-concept-with-businessman-balancing-on-dollar-line-placed-on-book-stacks.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOne of the most common pitfalls that small investors make is that they want to put everything into a high risk investment in the hopes of making a big gain very quickly. In fact, this strategy rarely works, and instead leaves the investor with virtually nothing. Avoid picking “get rich quick” accounts and instead look for highly diverse investments with low fees.\r\n\r\n### Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3767\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3767\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 tax advantage small investor](/posts/5-tax-advantage-small-investor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3767\">[hindesy](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-275734745/stock-photo-eggsk-nest-egg.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe federal government has set up a number of accounts and programs to help small investors. Roth IRAs and 401(k)s were originally designed to help Americans prepare for their retirement. Because of this, you don’t have to pay taxes on the money going into these accounts. If you’re a typical taxpayer, that means that you’re essentially earning 15% or more on your investment just from the tax advantage alone. There are a variety of investments that you can make within these accounts, giving you a lot of options for your money. Also be sure to research other ways the money in these accounts can be used, such as financing higher education or buying a home.\r\n\r\n### Look at ways to create multiple income streams\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3768\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3768\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 multiple income streams small investor](/posts/6-multiple-income-streams-small-investor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3768\">[Andrey_Popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-306265091/stock-photo-young-businesswoman-working-with-graphs-on-computers-at-desk.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen you have a small amount to invest, it’s important to keep your investments diverse. This enables you to have at least one account that is making money, even when the other ones are contracting. Try for a mix of bonds, stocks, and other investments such as commodities and real estate. As your portfolio grows, you can eliminate the low performers and find funds with better return rates. You may also want to consider reinvesting a small part of your money into more exotic investments as time goes on.\r\n\r\n### Stay out of debt\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3769\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3769\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 stay out of debt small investor](/posts/7-stay-out-of-debt-small-investor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3769\">[Melody_Smart](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-381760273/stock-photo-business-woman-writing-no-more-debts-and-unpaid-bills-unemployment-and-personal-bankruptcy.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt can be very tempting for small investors to take out loans in order to increase the pool of money that they have to invest. These loans tend to come at high interest rates, however, that can eat through your potential profits. Furthermore, if you start to lose money, you greatly diminish your investment by having to pay back the loan. Avoid taking on debt to make money, and stick to just making smaller investments with you available cash.\r\n\r\n### Don’t follow the herd\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3770\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3770\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 stay out of the herd small investor](/posts/8-stay-out-of-the-herd-small-investor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3770\">[rangizzz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-89995051/stock-photo-male-hand-putting-coin-into-a-piggy-bank.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOften, small investors make the mistake of putting their money into something simply because larger investors are doing so. The problem with this strategy is that by the time a small investor hears about someone making a lot of money, the real opportunity has already passed. In fact, small investors are often targets for larger investors who need to unload unprofitable investments. To avoid problems, stick to the strategies that you know work, and ignore what everyone else is doing.\r\n\r\n### Learn to invest on your own\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3771\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3771\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Learn to invest on your own small investor](/posts/9-Learn-to-invest-on-your-own-small-investor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3771\">[Shawn_Hempel](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-136649924/stock-photo-books-with-penny-jar-filled-with-coins-and-banknotes-tuition-or-education-financing-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen you have to rely on a financial advisor to tell you where to put your money, you are limited to only what he or she wants to sell you. The best thing a small investor can do for him or herself is learn as much as possible about investing. Learn about your options, strategies, and the ideas that experts have about why those strategies will or won’t work in the future. The goal is to get the point where you can invest without relying on anyone else’s plan or advice. This wa,y you can personalize your investment strategy to meet you needs.\r\n"

It’s a nice feeling that doesn’t happen as often as most of us would like. Thankfully, you don’t need to go out and start investing in expensive paintings or hold onto dated bottles of wine to realize such an increase in value. You may have something in your wallet that is worth far more than the printed value. Some dollar bills, due to errors in the printing or limited prints can be worth thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. So, before you slide a bill into the vending machine, make sure to give it a once over.\r\n\r\n### Check For Strange Serial Numbers\r\n\r\nAll bills printed in the United States have some sort of serial number printed on it (so theoretically every dollar bill can be traced, to an extent). Some strange serial numbers happen to be worth more than just your standard $1 bill. Some prints to look for include:\r\n\r\n- Double quads on a $1 bill (such as 77774444)\r\n- Repeaters (often referred to as a “Super Repeater”) on a bill, where two numbers are repeated throughout the serial numbers (like 93939393)\r\n- Seven of a kind on a $1 bill (44484444)\r\n- The same number repeated seven or more times (2222222)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it’s almost like playing an extreme form of poker, but if you see anything like this on your bills, you’ll be able to cash in for more than $1.\r\n\r\n### What Kind of Cash is it Worth?\r\n\r\nAlright, so the prints may be worth more than $1, but is it really worth that much more? After all, do you really want to go through the trouble of tracking down someone to sell the bill to if it’s only worth $1.25? Probably not. However, these bills are actually worth a considerable amount.\r\n\r\nThe serial number is everything, so even if it isn’t one of the serial numbers listed above, anything out of the ordinary can bring in some nice money. In 2013, a man paid up to $1,000 for $2 bills containing the serial number of “07041776”.\r\n\r\nThe redesign of the new $100 bill, when it came out in 2013, ended up selling for a pretty penny as well. As it had the serial number of “..00001”, it ended up going for $15,000. Of course, having the very first of a bill isn’t all that likely, but you never know, which is why checking is well worth it.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not in the United States (or if you have a stack of bills from your European vacation from a few years ago) don’t worry, as the same thing holds true with other currency as well. Odd serial numbers are worth more money with popular currencies, such as the British pound (an eBay seller made 7,100 pounds off of a 20 pound coin a few years ago).\r\n\r\nBasically, what all this means is you need to start checking your bills whenever you receive a new one. You never know what it might actually be worth.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nAs with most things in life, timing is everything.\r\n\r\nThinking about dabbling in the stock market? Wondering when is the best time to invest in a company. Buy now or wait? Own some stock and want to know why it has gone up or down in value. What are the internal or external influences? The list below summarizes some of the top reasons why a company’s stock price goes up or down.\r\n\r\nBefore getting to the list, understand this first fundamental rule that many individuals forget: The **value** of a company is its **market capitalization**, which is the stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. **Stock price does not equate to value.** For example, Company “X” trades for $100/share and has 10mm shares outstanding has a lesser value than Company “Y” that trades for $50/share and has 50mm shares outstanding. Before you buy, research the company you are thinking about investing. There is a wealth of information available on many financial investment websites.\r\n\r\n## Keep in mind that stock prices are volatile and can change in price extremely rapidly. Now to factors that effect a stock price to change:\r\n\r\n- \\***\\*Announcement of dividends** –\\*\\* Always great if it is the same amount as in the past. If lower, why?\r\n- **Introduction of a new product or a product recall** – Is it a minor or major recall? Can it easily be fixed? Will this affect the company’s reputation?\r\n- **Securing a new large contract** – This may look good on the surface, but what other issues can arise such as strain on cash reserve, hiring new employees, secure a new location, etc.\r\n- **Employee layoffs** – permanent or seasonal employees? What caused the reduction?\r\n- **Anticipated takeover or merger** – Stay informed and get news feeds, Twitter, and other updates\r\n- **A change of management** – Who left and why?\r\n- **Supply and demand –** If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up.\r\n- **Earnings –** Profits the company makes. Public companies report earnings 4 times a year. Stock market analysts base company’s future value on their earnings projection.\r\n- **Investors’ sentiments, attitudes and expectations that ultimately affect stock prices.**\r\n- **Economic Strength of Market and Peers –** Company stocks tend to track with the market and with their sector or industry peers. A suddenly negative outlook for one retail stock often hurts other retail stocks as “guilt by association” drags down demand for the whole sector.\r\n- **Accounting errors or scandals**\r\n\r\nAnd for the final factor: **Nobody really knows for sure**. Some believe that it isn’t possible to predict how stock prices will change, while others think that by drawing charts and looking at past price movements, you can determine when to buy and sell.\r\n"

No matter how good you are, computers will always be able to do it faster and with fewer errors. So, if you crunch numbers, there is a chance your job will not be around within the next decade. Of course there are exceptions, but always know when analytics come to play, computers will always be able to do it better.\r\n\r\n### Spend Most of Your Time on a Computer\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3831\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3831\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 Spend Most of Your Time on a Computer job work](/posts/2-Spend-Most-of-Your-Time-on-a-Computer-job.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3831\">[Jacob_Lund](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-166600271/stock-photo-high-angle-view-of-an-young-brunette-working-at-her-office-desk-with-documents-and-laptop.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIs most of your time spent on computers? Well, there is a chance you may not have a job in 10 years. Now, if you are an IT professional that is different as you are making sure the computers work, and there are other job types on computers that don’t need to worry (research work and other tasks performed on the computer will not be replaced by computers). General computer tasks though will be replaced. This is already happening around the world as cashiers, who simply controlled point of sales computers, are being replaced by self-scan registers. It still takes a person to monitor these registers, but instead of having six or eight cashiers there is just one person and six or eight machines.\r\n\r\n### Similar Jobs Have Been Replaced\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3832\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3832\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 Similar Jobs Have Been Replaced job loss work](/posts/3-Similar-Jobs-Have-Been-Replaced-job-loss.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3832\">[Andrey_Popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-331280702/stock-photo-close-up-of-unemployed-businesspeople-carrying-cardboard-boxes.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nHave you noticed other jobs that are similar to yours have been replaced by a computer (or just are no longer around)? If so it is a major red flag and you should be worried. It likely means it is only a matter of time before your job is taken. So, if you have this kind of a red flag it is time to possibly start looking for other available jobs in a different field.\r\n\r\n### Production Costs Are Increasing\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3833\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3833\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Production Costs Are Increasing job loss work](/posts/4-Production-Costs-Are-Increasing-job-loss.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3833\">[elsar](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-292970294/stock-photo--d-rendering-conceptual-image-of-dollars-symbolizing-the-rising-prices.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAre production costs starting to increase for your line of work? Perhaps the business is experiencing higher costs and they are looking for ways to reduce manufacturing cost. If so, they may look to invest in computers, machinery or robots, which can pay for the investment within just a few years. Production cost often has a major influence on any monetary changes within the company, and if your company is experiencing these financial issues, watch out.\r\n\r\n### You Work Minimum Wage\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3834\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3834\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 You Work Minimum Wage job loss work](/posts/5-You-Work-Minimum-Wage-job-loss.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3834\">[Lisa_F.\\_Young](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-164151167/stock-photo-unhappy-teenage-girl-has-a-boring-job-serving-fast-food-isolated-on-white.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you work minimum wage, your job is always on the chopping block. Fast food workers are often in the direct line of fire and it appears by asking for more money they have actually put an expiration date on their own jobs. Recently, fast food workers around the United States picketed for $15 an hour, which is around double minimum wage. This kind of monetary increase would force the price of meals to skyrocket, so instead of doing that many chains are starting to place automated computers instead of cashiers. Even restaurants are doing this by placing digital menus on the tables so servers are not needed, only a handful of runners to bring out the food.\r\n\r\n### You Work With Dangerous Material\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3835\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3835\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 You Work With Dangerous Material job loss work](/posts/6-You-Work-With-Dangerous-Material-job-loss.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3835\">[Sherry_Yates_Young](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-396496681/stock-photo-health-care-worker-s-gloved-hand-with-hazardous-waste-container-and-bag.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDo you work with dangerous material? This can be hazardous chemicals or liquid metal. It is easier for companies to bring in machines to do this kind of dangerous work because,while it is more expensive to have it installed and setup, it is far less expensive to insure, plus there is no training required, just occasional maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Pinpoint Accuracy is Required\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3836\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3836\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Pinpoint Accuracy is Required job loss work](/posts/7-Pinpoint-Accuracy-is-Required-job-loss.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3836\">[ne3p](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-348624275/stock-photo-watchmaker-picked-up-the-tiny-escape-wheel-part-very-carefully-to-mainplate.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDoes your job require pinpoint accuracy? Surgeons now use computers and machines to invoke steady hands during surgery and other medical treatments, but these individuals will not be replaced in the next decade (eventually it is possible but not in the last 10 years). When this kind of accuracy is required, there is a good chance a machine is able to come in and deliver a much more accurate production.\r\n\r\n### Creativity Is Not Required\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3837\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3837\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Creativity Is Not Required job loss work](/posts/8-Creativity-Is-Not-Required-job-loss.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3837\">[dmitry_kalinosky](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-98430122/stock-photo-worker-with-fork-pallet-truck-stacker-in-warehouse-loading-furniture-panels.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCreativity will never be replicated by machines, at least not anywhere in the near future. It takes cognitive thought in order to do anything creative without training or repetition. You need to think about your job and whether or not creativity is required. If no creativity is required for your job, it means there will always be a chance for it to be replaced. So, if you are in the creative arts, your job is safe. While not a glaring red flag, if you can compound this issue with other possible red flags, you may have a larger problem then you believe.\r\n\r\n### Manual Labor\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3838\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3838\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Manual Labor job loss work](/posts/9-Manual-Labor-job-loss.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3838\">[photographee.eu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-140340346/stock-photo-construction-of-a-modern-building-and-a-skyscraper.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIs most of your job manual labor? If so, it is a red flag for not being around within the next decade. If you work in a warehouse, machines are able to select the accurate items, move and process them much faster than a human. Even in construction, there are jobs that machines can do. Specially designed brick laying machines make laying out a brick floor easier, faster, and less expensive. All it takes is one or two people to run the machine and the rest is taken care of. Humans simply can’t compete with the weight lifting capabilities of machines.\r\n\r\n### Degree Not Required\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3839\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3839\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ Degree Not Required job loss work](/posts/10-Degree-Not-Required-job-loss.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3839\">[Andrey_Burmakin](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-113762116/stock-photo-hand-of-a-man-using-a-hotel-bell.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDoes your job require a degree? When you need a degree (especially a graduate level degree) it means you need special training and knowledge to perform jobs. When you don’t have a degree it reduces the amount of training required, which means it is more likely for a machine or basic robot to come in and take the job. Receptionists at hotels and hospitals are now being replaced by robots, so if you don’t have a degree, it might be time to seek one out.\r\n"

CBS traditionally carries AFC games while FOX broadcasts the NFC. You can even watch Sunday Night football on NBC. Now, you’ll miss out on Monday Night Football, but if all you want is professional football, the antenna is very much a viable option. If you don’t want to install an antenna, there are other ways to get your NFL fix. One is sure to work for your particular needs.\r\n\r\n### PlayStation Vue\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4612\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4612\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![playstation cable](/posts/playstation-e1505931858690.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4612\">[sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of TV streaming options out there. PlayStation Vue is one of the better options simply because you have access to both local broadcasts and cable channels (with Sling, you don’t have local broadcasts, which means you’ll still need to rely on an antenna, which is great if you’re in a more populated area, but not so great if you live in a rural part of the country). PlayStation Vue gives you access to all ESPN channels (which means Monday Night Football), Fox stations and local broadcasts. And don’t worry, you don’t need a PlayStation to use it. PlayStation Vue works on Roku, AppleTV and other streaming devices.\r\n\r\nThere are now other streaming options to consider. SlingTV does work if you want ESPN, but you won’t get the local broadcasts, so keep this in mind. HuluTV can work as well and comes at a slightly less expensive price, but only works on a handful of devices right now (Roku and PlayStation are not supported as of yet). DirecTV Now is another option as well. Whatever you decide to go with, most streaming services offer a free trial, so you can always test each out and see what you like the best.\r\n\r\n### Sports Bar\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4614\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4614\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![sports bar cable](/posts/sports-bar-e1505932434379.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4614\">[skitown](https://www.skitownrestaurants.com/park-city-slideshow/best-park-city-bars-clubs-nightlife.php)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou have your antenna for local broadcasts. That’s great and all, but what about those Monday Night games? Why not go to the sports bar? It’s a nice way to finish up a Monday and watching the game there a few times a month is potentially cheaper than paying for cable all year.\r\n\r\n### NFL Sunday Ticket\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4616\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4616\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![NFL Ticket cable](/posts/pexels-photo-200986.jpeg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4616\">[Robert Villalta](https://www.pexels.com/photo/football-stadium-during-night-200986/)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWatching the NFL when you’re in your favorite team’s broadcast area is relatively easy (and potentially inexpensive, if not free). However, what should you do if you’re a fan of a different team? You’re best bet is order NFL Sunday Ticket. You can do this through the NFL Network, although it will cost you (potentially around $70 a month).\r\n\r\n### Switch Your Mobile Provider\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4617\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4617\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![watch on smartphone cable](/posts/watch-on-smartphone-e1505933075304.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4617\">[geralt](https://pixabay.com/en/football-american-football-1590477/)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nVerizon Wireless does allow all of its mobile users to stream any NFL game over their phone. Don’t want to watch the big game on a small screen? Pick up a Google Chromecast. It allows you to throw the image from your phone onto your TV screen. If you’re in a relationship, maybe consider one person signing up for Verizon and the other signing up for T-Mobile (this company offers the MLB package to all customers).\r\n"

If the college student does not have any kind of credit report available, they may not qualify for this card, but it is worth checking out. It offers one percent cash back on everything and another one percent back for monthly bill payments. Plus, there is no annual fee, so it is a nice card to have when moving from college into the working world.\r\n\r\n## Chase Slate\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3857\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 chase slate credit cards](/posts/2-chase-slate-credit-card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3857\">[rawpixel.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-372249523/stock-photo-people-shopping-spending-customer-consumerism-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is a solid card when it comes to financing. It is a free balance transfer card that offers a 15 month zero introductory interest rate. For students who are new to credit cards or who just want to get the hang of credit card spending and paying off, this is a nice way to go. Plus, if they have an older student credit card and want to transfer a balance over they can, as the zero percent interest rate covers transfers as well. This card also does not have any kind of annual fee.\r\n\r\n## Journey Student Rewards From Capital One\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3858\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3858\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 Journey Student Rewards From Capital One credit cards](/posts/3-Journey-Student-Rewards-From-Capital-One-credit-card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3858\">[Aleksandra_Gigowska](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-110115272/stock-photo-closeup-of-blue-credit-card-holded-by-hand-focus-on-card.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFor this card a .edu email account is required, but for most college graduates, their email account will stay active for some time. This is a card that is good for students who have no credit history, or at least a very limited history. It provides a one percent cash back on all purchases and a 1.25 percent cash back when the monthly bill is paid on time, plus it doesn’t have any kind of annual fee to it.\r\n\r\n## BankAmericard Cash Wards for Students Credit Card\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3859\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3859\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 BankAmericard Cash Wards for Students Credit Cards](/posts/4-BankAmericard-Cash-Wards-for-Students-Credit-Card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3859\">[Monkey_Business_Images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-134273504/stock-photo-couple-enjoying-meal-in-outdoor-restaurant.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFor recent graduates, this card comes with a nice initial bonus. After spending $500 within the first 90 days (which likely will happen when just buying groceries and gas) the card provides a $100 cash bonus. Plus, the user receives three percent cash back on gas and two percent cash back on groceries, plus one percent back on everything else. The card also doesn’t have an annual fee. This is a solid card for students who don’t have any real credit history or have a limited credit history.\r\n\r\n## BankAmericard Travel Rewards for Students Credit Card\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3860\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3860\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 BankAmericard Travel Rewards for Students Credit Cards](/posts/5-BankAmericard-Travel-Rewards-for-Students-Credit-Card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3860\">[Patty_Chan](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-262466249/stock-photo-wing-of-an-airplane-flying-above-the-ocean.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nNow, most students right out of college will not be able to qualify for the big time travel credit cards like an AMEX Platinum or Double Gold. That doesn’t mean they can’t start earning points toward travel now and apply for another card later on after their credit history is built up. With this rewards card, designed for students with no credit or limited credit history (and an .edu email address), the holder receives 20,000 points after spending $1,000 within the first 90 days. This is good for $200 in travel purchases. Plus, it offers 1.5 points per $1 spent and there is no annual fee or foreign transaction fee.\r\n\r\n## Capital One Secured MasterCard\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3861\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3861\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Capital One Secured MasterCard credit cards](/posts/6-Capital-One-Secured-MasterCard-credit-card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3861\">[Ollyy](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-290048066/stock-photo-window-shopping.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt is easy to fall into some credit traps early on in college. Whether just going out to restaurants too often or abusing free credit card signups to receive perks around campus, after graduation it is time to get smart about credit. This credit card is designed for grades with either an inactive .edu email or poor credit. It is a partially secured card, which means the credit line can go up, depending on credit standing, disposable income, and a few other factors. It doesn’t have any annual fees, which is good. Now, also it doesn’t have any real perks, but for simply building a credit report up, this is a fine card to have.\r\n\r\n## Capital One Platinum Credit Card\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3862\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3862\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Capital One Platinum Credit Card](/posts/7-Capital-One-Platinum-Credit-Card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3862\">[michaeljung](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-113480041/stock-photo-two-young-women-shopping-in-mall.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is another card for poor credit or no credit and your .edu email is inactive. There is no security deposit required and you don’t need to have any credit history to receive approval for the card. There also is no annual fee charged. Now, the card isn’t secured, so if you have really bad credit it may not approve you, but if you’d like to avoid paying a deposit, this is a card worth checking in on.\r\n\r\n## Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3863\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3863\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card](/posts/8-Capital-One-Quicksilver-Cash-Rewards-Credit-Card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3863\">[syda_productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-147043022/stock-photo-shopping-and-tourism-concept-beautiful-girls-with-shopping-bags-and-credit-card-in-ctiy.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis card provides a 1.5 percent bonus on everything you buy and it gives you a $100 bonus after spending $500 in the first 90 days. You also don’t have an annual fee and 0 percent interest on purchases made within the first nine months. The interest does bump up anywhere from 13 to 23 percent, so keep this in mind, and it is a credit card that you’ll likely only receive if you have medium to good credit, but in terms of an initial bonus, it is hard to beat it.\r\n\r\n## Regions Student Relationship Rewards Visa Credit Card\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3864\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3864\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Regions Student Relationship Rewards Visa Credit Card](/posts/9-Regions-Student-Relationship-Rewards-Visa-Credit-Card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3864\">[gpoinstudio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-170274842/stock-photo-smiling-man-making-order-by-mobile-phone.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is a nice card if you are going for a financing based credit card. There is no annual fee, zero percent financing on anything you buy within the first year and it has some nice perks you can select from after signing up. It is a credit card you do need to have a good credit history for, but as a student credit card, it also isn’t expecting anything extensive.\r\n\r\n## Discover It Secured Credit Card\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3865\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3865\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Discover It Secured Credit Card](/posts/10-Discover-It-Secured-Credit-Card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3865\">[Andresr](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-137167427/stock-photo-group-of-people-paying-for-drinks-at-the-bar-and-smiling.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is another credit card that is designed for people who you don’t have an active .edu email address and whose credit score is poor. It does require a security deposit of $200, but it doesn’t have an annual fee, provides two percent cash back at restaurants and gas stations, plus one percent cash back on everything else. For a secured credit card, it is hard to get anything better.\r\n"

However, if you visit the coffee shop a few times a week it can really add up. Thankfully, there are a handful of ways to save money on each and every trip you make. Here are six easy tips to follow in order to save some cash on your next Starbucks run.\r\n\r\n### Bring Your Own Cup\r\n\r\nDid you know if you bring your own refillable cup (or even a paper cup from a different coffee shop) you’ll have your price dropped by 10 cents. It’s not a ton, but if you go to Starbucks every day you’ll end up saving about $37 every single year.\r\n\r\n### Self-Made Latte\r\n\r\nIf you normally buy lattes at Starbucks you know you pay a premium for the beverage. However, there is a less expensive way to do this. Instead of ordering your own latte, purchase two or three shots of espresso. Now, add your own cream, sugar, cinnamon or other condiments at the service station. It’s far less and you have a bit more customization options. You can even do the same thing over ice (order two shots of espresso over ice). Again, you’ll save a substantial amount over what you’d normally pay for an iced latte.\r\n\r\n### (Almost) Free Refill\r\n\r\nWho can stop after just one cup of coffee? Maybe you like a Starbucks on your way to work and then grab one on the way home. Instead of buying another cup of Joe at full price bring your cup back into the store. When you do this you’ll be charged $.50 instead of the normal, full price.\r\n\r\n### Two Teas For the Price of One\r\n\r\nWhen Starbucks brews its tea it makes it extra strong. It then mixes the tea with water when served. This way the equipment doesn’t take up as much space in the storefront. So, when you order a tea ask for them to not add water and then request a water cup. You can now divvy up the tea and add your own water, giving you two teas for the price of one.\r\n\r\n### Rewards Program\r\n\r\nIt’s pretty straight forward. Join the Starbuck’s rewards program. After 12 purchases, your next is on the house (and that includes food). You’ll even land a free beverage on your birthday.\r\n\r\n### Ditch the Ice\r\n\r\nWhen ordering an iced beverage, ask for either ice on the side or no ice. The beverage is made chilled so it will still be cold. However, the ice takes up most of the cup. So, if you get ice on the side you’ll end up with more beverage. You won’t technically save money, but you’ll get twice the amount of beverage for the same price.\r\n\r\nBy taking advantage of these six different tips, you’ll save money whenever you go to Starbucks. No matter where you live or how often you visit, you are sure to love Starbucks even more, now that you can go and spend less.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## Automation is Your Friend\r\n\r\nStressing out over money is nothing new. Everyone does it and many people worry about money on a daily basis. One of the best ways to cut down the stress is to remove some of the issues you’re thinking about. One of these issues is likely remembering to pay bills on time. That is why you need to turn to automation.\r\n\r\nAutomation allows you to set up auto payments for different bills. Some you may want to have a look over before paying (such as your credit card bills), but others that do not change on a monthly basis, such as Internet, mobile phone or student loans can go on an automated withdraw from your bank account. This way, you don’t need to remember to pay it on time. The system takes care of it for you.\r\n\r\n## Start Investing\r\n\r\n![thinking an investment advisor is enough](/posts/shutterstock_283523774.jpg)\r\n\r\nIs your money working for you? It should be. The extra money you have after paying bills should either go towards paying down current debt (like those student loans) or into an investment. Even if you can only put in $5 or $10 a week into investments, this adds up quickly. Applications like Stash make it easy to set this up. Also, services like “Keep the Change” from Bank of America round up debit card purchases to the nearest dollar and put the “change” into a different account. Set this to an investment account and you’ll start to see the money grow.\r\n\r\n## Take Control of Those Student Loans\r\n\r\n![college is expensive](/posts/shutterstock_13653856-e1478033541781.jpg)\r\n\r\nGoing to college is expensive. Really expensive. Especially if your best educational option is to head out of state (or go to a private college). This may have left you with tens of thousands, if not nearly $100,000 in debt. Worrying about paying this back is real and simply seeing that giant number is enough to make your head spin. However, if you’re struggling to meet the monthly requirements, don’t just stop paying it.\r\n\r\nYou can’t file for bankruptcy and opt out of student loans (too many people did this a few decades ago so student loans now do not go away when going through bankruptcy). There are income repayment options, and if you contact your student loan provider you can tell them you’re not able to make the payments and, chances are, they will have a reduce payment option (which lasts for six or 12 months).\r\n\r\n## Cutting Costs is Easier Now than Ever\r\n\r\n![price range wedding](/posts/shutterstock_418403209.jpg)\r\n\r\nNearly everything costs more now. iPhones are costing $1,000 and over. Major cell phone providers charge you $100 a month for service. Cable and Internet is probably costing you another nice chunk of change. All of this adds up. Thankfully, you do have options at cutting costs. In terms of bills, consider looking around for a different provider.\r\n\r\nMany of the discounted cell phone companies actually purchase data and mobile services directly through the larger companies like Sprint, so there isn’t much in terms of service drop off, yet you’ll only spend $40 or so a month (way better than $100). Nix your cable and go with a streaming service (SlingTV only costs $20 a month). Shop around for different insurance providers. If you’re paying for a service, consider if you need it, and if you do, look around to see if you can find it for less.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nWater is a big deal, especially when it comes it health. We consume about 3 quarts of water daily, just to survive. Many celebs including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Jared Leto, to name a few are turning to an alkaline diet, which includes drinking alkaline water. The idea behind an alkaline diet is to maintain a good alkaline-acid balance in your body. This is accomplished by keeping your blood chemistry level at the slightly alkaline pH level of 7.4. You can eat plant foods high in alkaline levels such as fruits and vegetables, seeds, nuts, seeds, and healthy oils are rich in iron, magnesium, copper, calcium, and zinc. You can also drink water that has higher alkaline levels.\r\n\r\n### Alkaline pH Level\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3624\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3624\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![alkaline water test](/posts/alkaline-water-test.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3624\">[Shutterstock- sirirak kaewgorn](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=349337957)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOne reason behind drinking alkaline water is that it helps the body get rid of toxins. The toxins we are referring to are acids, those foods with a high acidic content high, especially meats, breads, pasta, soft drinks, seafood, jams and jellies to name a few. To maintain the right pH balance while detoxifying, you need to consume foods and drinks with an abundance of alkaline buffers. Most noteworthy is alkaline water. Water high in alkaline contains magnesium, potassium, calcium, silica, and bicarbonate which helps buffers a body’s acidity level.\r\n\r\n### Alkaline Water Benefits\r\n\r\nSome studies reported that [drinking water](/can-your-water-be-killing-you-the-good-and-the-bad) with high alkaline levels helps your gut by protecting your body from bad bacteria or viruses. Additionally, lab experiments have shown that alkaline water lowers a body’s glycemic (blood sugar) index, reduces liver damage, and diabetes. In addition, athletes drink alkaline water to help increase their performance before fatigue sets in, often triggered by increased acid levels. Lastly, Dr.Oz wrote in his blog that drinking high quality alkaline water can greatly improve various gastrointestinal disorders.\r\n\r\nAll water is not the same. Some are filtered, purified, treated, distilled, deionized, and alkaline. To maintain a high alkaline level, look for a bottle labeled with a pH level of 7.0 to get the best benefit. Labs tested many water brands to measure their pH levels. These are some of their top findings:\r\n\r\n- Waiakea Hawaiian Volcanic Water 8.8\r\n- Mountain Valley 8.35\r\n- Dannon Natural spring water 7.84\r\n- Deer Park 7.8\r\n- Evian 7.9\r\n- VOSS 7.6\r\n- Whole Foods 365 Water 7.5\r\n- Zephyrhills 7.5\r\n- Fiji 7.5\r\n- Vittel 7.5\r\n\r\nCheck with your local water district and determine your tap water pH level. You may be surprised. Here’s some samples:\r\n\r\n- St. Louis tap water 9.5\r\n- Palm Beach Municipal water 8.13\r\n- Los Angeles tap water 7.5\r\n- New York City tap water 7.0\r\n\r\nLastly, consult your physician before drinking water with high alkaline levels, especially if you have a kidney disorder.\r\n\r\nWhat brand of water do you drink?\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## Credit Card Expiration Date Doesn’t Matter\r\n\r\nEvery single credit card you’ve ever pulled out of your wallet has an expiration date pressed right into the front of it. However, have you ever noticed that whenever you receive a replacement card at the end of the “expiration” period the card number is exactly the same? This is because the expiration date really isn’t an expiration date at all.\r\n\r\nIt simply gives your credit provider a general idea as to when a new card should be issued (after all, most credit cards start to deteriorate after extensive use). The expiration date does help with fraud prevention though as it is just another set of numbers required during an online or over-the-phone purchase.\r\n\r\n## Sears Created the Credit Card\r\n\r\nNow, the idea of credit has been around for a long time. However, the concept of a credit card first began with Sears back in 1911. The store issued cards with the printed number on it as an account number (it didn’t include the magnetic strip until later).\r\n\r\nSears even went on to create the Discover Card. However, the Sears card no longer exists, as Citigroup bought up the card, the credit debt and the membership list.\r\n\r\n## Diner’s Card Was the First Multi-Location Card\r\n\r\nYou may have heard of the Diner’s Club Card before. Chances are you’ve seen logos for the card, but you may have never actually seen it in person. While the Diner’s Club Card is more or less a thing of the past, it served as the very first credit card that could be used at multiple locations (up until this point cards, such as the Sear’s card, could only be used at a specific location). As you might guess, the Diner’s Club Card was created for eating at restaurants in New York.\r\n\r\n## Your High Interest Rate is Illegal (But There’s Nothing You Can Do About It)\r\n\r\nAll states have what is known as a “usury law.” This is a law put into effect that establishes a maximum interest rate financial institutions can charge. This rate varies wildly from one state to the next (in California it is 7 percent while it is 16 percent in New York). Chances are, your credit card interest rate is far higher than the state allowed usury law. So how is this possible? Due to a 1978 Supreme Court ruling on Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis vs. First of Omaha Services Corp, state laws do not apply to a national bank.\r\n\r\n## Turn Down Your Higher Interest Rate\r\n\r\nThere may be a time where a credit card company tries to increase your interest rate. However, under the Credit Card Accountability Disclosure Act, you can refuse the higher rate. Just call them up, tell them you won’t pay it and ask for it in writing. Just be warned if you try this, the bank may try to raise your monthly minimum payments, lower your credit line or cancel your cards, so take all of this into consideration.\r\n"

You’ve put so much time and effort into where you are currently, do you really want to start over? Many will tell you to just stick in the industry and ride it out, but sometimes changing your career is the right decision, not only for you but for your family. It can breathe new life into you and, unlike a 40 year old who has been working the same industry for nearly two decades, you’ll energize yourself with a fresh, new attitude. So whatever your current career is, taking the road less traveled might just open you up to some incredible surprises.\r\n\r\n### It’s Time to Take Control\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4406\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4406\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![time to take control](/posts/shutterstock_475214050.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4406\">  \r\n[GoneWithTheWind](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/classy-mature-woman-breaking-chains-isolated-475214050)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nUnless you run your own business, aren’t you a bit tired of just being another cog in the business machine? You do what is expected of you and what you are told. What you do likely doesn’t differ all that much from day to day and it can leave you feeling not only mundane but uninspired. When you [change career paths at 40](/10-ways-to-change-careers-in-your-40s-and-beyond) you are shaking free the chains of your current job and taking control of your life. Yes, it can be nerve racking and even a bit frightening, but you’ll also never feel more alive. Plus, taking control of your career will provide a boost of professional confidence you’ve possibly never had before.\r\n\r\n### Get the Rewards You Want\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4404\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4404\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Change careers after 40 get rewards changing your career](/posts/shutterstock_308851766.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4404\">  \r\n [ra2studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/business-woman-on-road-heading-toward-308851766)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe problem with staying in one particular career path or one particular company is you receive the rewards the company is willing to offer. Sometimes these are great, other times you may feel like something is missing. By switching your career path at 40, you can go after a job that offers the rewards you want. Whether you want to start your own business or move to an entirely different industry, you have a better understand now than when you first started on what to look for and desirable rewards.\r\n\r\n### Spread Your Wings\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4407\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4407\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![spread your wings](/posts/shutterstock_263748254.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4407\">  \r\n[Gajus](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-businessman-business-suit-showing-small-263748254)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe world is a pretty big place. Why lock yourself down? Maybe you’ve always wanted to try and work for a Japanese firm and take in the culture of Tokyo. Perhaps you’ve been craving warmer weather with a new outlook on life and a new industry popping up in Miami just looks amazing. Life is simply too short and the world is to large for you to stay in your box. Now is the perfect time to spread your wings and experience something new. It may end up being the most important decision you ever make.\r\n\r\n### What’s the Traffic Light Saying?\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4408\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4408\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![what's the traffic light saying changing your career](/posts/shutterstock_537386812.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4408\">[ M-SUR](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/traffic-jam-vs-open-road-sign-537386812?src=WhXI757koSD9U1waldxHPg-3-60)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIsn’t it great when you take the same drive you always do but you just somehow hit all the green lights. Then, out of nowhere, a yellow pops up. Do you stamp down the gas to make it, or do you take what you’ve been given and just stop? Your work life may be exactly like this. You coast along in the job, enjoying what it has to offer, but then one day, you realize everything has slowed down, and maybe you’ve even come to a stop. You’ve spent so much time in the one career path you didn’t even realize you no longer are moving. Changing your career path is like hitting the gas and taking that yellow. Yes, be cautious, but it can open you up to a brand new way of enjoying new opportunities and a new career.\r\n\r\n### The Thrill of Something New\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4409\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4409\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![thrill of something new](/posts/shutterstock_305253032.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4409\">[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/two-women-optimistic-lady-having-solution-305253032)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nExperiencing something new and fresh for the first time is incredible. Like that new feeling of falling in love. Everything is just a bit different and fresh. You’re experiencing the same things but with someone different. It’s exciting and exhilarating. All of this is true with a new career path. When you first started, you might have felt excited and thrilled with new challenges, but now, after a decade or two on the job, it may just feel old. Like you are stuck and nothing is changing. You no longer have that thrill you loved. It doesn’t mean you need to remain in the job though and simply accept it. By [switching your career path](/10-steps-for-a-successful-career-change) you can regain that new thrill and that new feeling of the unexpected. Even if the new career is similar to what you use to do, you’ll be experiencing these similar feelings in a brand new way, which can be incredibly exciting.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n**1. Color Scheme**  \r\nColor scheme plays a big role in just about everything restaurants do. This is especially the case when it comes to fast food (have you ever noticed almost all fast food restaurants use the color red?). The colors red and orange can make you feel hungrier. Darker red colors are also attention grabbers and spur action, which is why some of the more expensive offerings are listed with a red title. Additionally, green offers a mental connection to freshness.\r\n\r\n**2. Anchor Items**  \r\nWhen looking over a menu, there is almost always a noticeably more expensive menu item, parred with a handful of less expensive items. This is known as the \"anchor item.\" Basically, it is used to make the other items feel like a bargain. However, the more expensive item is typically a cut of pricier proteins, while the less expensive options are of inexpensive carbs. In reality, restaurants make more money off of the less expensive options because of the ingredients, yet restaurant goers feel as if they’re getting more for their money.\r\n\r\n**3. Dollar Signs Are Removed**  \r\nWhen looking over restaurant menus, most do not include the actual dollar sign. This is because dollar signs remind you that you’ll actually be spending money. Without the dollar sign it is just a number.\r\n\r\n**4. Overly Descriptive Descriptions**  \r\nFast food restaurants get right to the point with menu descriptions. In fact, most don’t even have descriptions, there’s just a picture of what you’ll receive. That isn’t usually the case though with a sit down restaurant. In fact, most restaurants instead use an overly descriptive description to try and sell you something. You may be amazed at how flowery the description can be in regards to onion rings. So why do restaurants go over the top in the descriptions? It makes it seem like you’re getting more for your money. On top of this, menus are now started to use keywords like locally sourced, locally grown or organic as selling points. So keep all of this in mind the next time you sit down for a meal and go through the extended menu description.\r\n\r\n**5. Second Least Expensive Wine**  \r\nThis is an old classic. You go into a restaurant, know you want to order a bottle of wine, but have no real idea what a good bottle is. Since you don’t want to look cheap, you go with the second least expensive bottle of wine. The thing about this is restaurants know this trick, so there is a hefty markup with the second least expensive bottle. In fact, the cheapest bottle of wine may actually cost more if you were to buy the bottle from a store and have a higher quality. If you want to save money, just go with the cheapest bottle. Nobody will think less of you for it and you won’t pay as much of a markup.\r\n"

He finds a company he believes in and begins buying shares in the company. As the company grows, he continues to buy more shares. This way, but the time the company is especially successful, he holds a large portion, or even a majority of the company. He first did this with the company Berkshire Hathaway, which is now a major holding company. The company itself now is specifically there for buying Warren’s investments. Not bad having a company dedicated to buying your own investments.\r\n\r\n### The Same Home\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4220\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4220\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![the same home](/posts/shutterstock_173980646.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4220\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-173980646/stock-photo-loving-senior-couple-relaxing-on-sofa-at-home.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOne of the largest expenses anyone has is their home. While Warren Buffet could afford a very large, very nice home (several of them) he has no need. That is why he still lives in the same home he purchased in Omaha for $31,500 in 1958. Now, this was still a good amount of money at the time, but he has not moved since as he really doesn’t have the need to go out and purchase another home. It is an example of how being wise with your money and frugal, without spending it on unnecessary things can help you in the long run.\r\n\r\n### One Car\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4219\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4219\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![one car](/posts/shutterstock_277878746-1.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4219\">[marchpn](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-277878746/stock-photo-portrait-of-an-handsome-smiling-asian-business-man-with-his-car-and-white-shirt.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWarren has found he doesn’t need to have multiple cars. What is the point? You can only drive one at a time. That is why he has driven the same Cadillac for the last decade. This is a major financial revelation many people need to understand. There is no need to go out and buy the latest object as soon as it comes out. Only buy something new when what you currently have costs too much to operate. Buffet also isn’t someone who goes out and buys the extremely expensive cars. He enjoys vehicles build by GM and Ford and avoids the massively expensive vehicles from other companies.\r\n\r\n### Enjoy the Vices\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4222\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4222\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![enjoy the vices](/posts/shutterstock_164748110.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4222\">[africa_studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-164748110/stock-photo-closeup-of-woman-eating-chocolate-cupcake.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEveryone has a vice. Even Warren. In fact, he drinks five Cokes a day. Some might think this would be substantially negative to his health, but he offsets the calorie and sugar intake by adjusting what he eats. This way he can allow the calories from Coca Cola without having it cause him health problems. Of course, he also owns about nine percent of the company, which is nice. While you likely won’t own nine percent of a company you enjoy a product from, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t find comfort in it. We all have our vices. As long as yours is safe in moderation, feel free to enjoy.\r\n\r\n### Always Read\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4221\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4221\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![always read](/posts/shutterstock_255385252.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4221\">[pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-255385252/stock-photo-charming-girl-sitting-by-wooden-table-and-reading-book.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to read something specifically connected to your business of choice. Warren Buffet is a book worm, but he doesn’t spend hours at a time with his nose in stock reports. Instead, he enjoys non fiction, so he often has multiple non fiction books around the office where he can be found reading when he isn’t working. This way he educates himself but not necessarily in business but simply in life.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Only When You Need To\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4229\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4229\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![upgrade only when you need to](/posts/shutterstock_406293349.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4229\">[pumtek](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-406293349/stock-photo-past-present-and-future-of-technology-and-devices-from-typewriter-to-computer.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf what you use works and does the job, why should you upgrade? Warren Buffet feels the same, which is why he still uses a simple flip phone. Many people would laugh at his flip phone, yet warren uses it to make phone calls and that is it. There really isn’t any need to spend more money into a phone that does things he’ll never need it to do. This is a major problem other people run into. They spend money on phones with devices they either don’t need or to replace a current phone that already works fine.\r\n\r\n### Donate To Causes\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4224\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4224\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![donate to causes](/posts/shutterstock_341522699.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4224\">[speedkingz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-341522699/stock-photo-woman-donating-unwanted-items-to-charity-shop.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWarren Buffet is a firm believer in donating money to causes he believes in. Warren is a stark believer in a woman’s right to choose, which is why he donates $100 million annually to different women’s groups around the country. These groups often struggle for money, which is why this financial donation is important. You don’t need to enter the same kind of monetary donation as Warren, but there is nothing wrong with giving to a cause you believe in.\r\n\r\n### The Rare Splurge\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4225\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4225\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![the rare splurge](/posts/shutterstock_249702325.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4225\">[potowizard](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-249702325/stock-photo-travel-the-world-monument-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOccasionally you have to treat yourself. Warren is someone who typically lives by the means of any ordinary businessman or woman. He drives the same car for years. He lives in the same house he’s had for half a century. But, unlike the average businessman or woman, he owns a private jet. Of course, with all of the business he does, having a private jet is helpful. He has a single jet he is able to use for personal and business travel.\r\n\r\n### Invests in Cars\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4226\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4226\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![invest in cars](/posts/shutterstock_73566850.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4226\">[paul_stringer](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-73566850/stock-photo-peterborough-england-may-23blue-peugeot-206cc-on-may-23-2009-in-peterborough-england-uk-peterborough-show-ground-is-host-to-annual-modified-nationals-automotive-show.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile Warren doesn’t spend his money on buying multiple vehicles at once, his money goes much further than that. He holds shares in General Motors through his Berkshire Hathaway company. He also has put money into 78 dealerships through five states and is looking to increase this monetary investment in dealerships over the next several years. As the auto industry has recovered, Warren has continued to put more and more money into it.\r\n\r\n### Know When to Invest\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4227\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4227\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![know when to invest](/posts/shutterstock_124525963.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4227\">[Zadorozhnyi_Viktor](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-124525963/stock-photo-accounting.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWarren often seems to have a sixth sense about investing, putting money into a company long before it has proven to be profitable at all. In the 1960s, American Express was struggling to stay afloat. However, Warren decided to buy his first shares of the company. He still holds a large percentage of AMEX stock, all of which he has accumulated since his initial purchase.\r\n"

Most people store butter in the molded compartment of their refrigerator doors. That’s fine if you plan to use it within a week after you buy it. If you don’t use that much butter, it is best to store it in the main body of the refrigerator. You may also freeze it. Wrap it tightly in plastic freezer wrap or heavy-duty aluminum foil. Heavy-duty freezer bags also work. Salted butter will keep up to 9 months in the freezer, while unsalted butter will last up to 6 months. Keep your freezer set at zero degrees to keep your foods safe indefinitely.\r\n\r\n### Eggs\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4203\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![eggs](/posts/shutterstock_113786020.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4203\">[sea_wave](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-113786020/stock-photo-eggs.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTo maximize the shelf life of your eggs, keep them refrigerated at all times. They will keep for 3 to 5 weeks after purchase. The “sell-by” date will usually expire during this time, but they will still be safe to eat. Avoid storing them in the egg rack of your refrigerator door because the temperature is warm, especially if you or your family opens the door many times throughout the day. Instead, store them in the main body of your refrigerator, where the temperature is cooler and more consistent. If you are unsure about the quality of your eggs, you can do a [float test](https://www.takepart.com/article/2015/06/11/spoiled-food) on them.\r\n\r\n### Milk\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4204\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4204\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![milk](/posts/shutterstock_135491168.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4204\">[Valentyn_Volkov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-135491168/stock-photo-pouring-milk-in-the-glass-on-the-background-of-nature.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMilk will be safe to drink for about one week after the expiration date on the jug, assuming that you have kept it refrigerated at or below 40 degrees at all times. To maximize the shelf life of milk, avoid storing it in the door of your refrigerator because the temperature is warmer and inconsistent. Instead, store it in the body of your refrigerator. You can freeze any milk that you aren’t able to use, but it will alter the texture, which may not be suitable for drinking. However, you can use the thawed milk for baking and cooking.\r\n\r\n### Ground Beef\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4205\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4205\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ground beef](/posts/shutterstock_269887775.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4205\">[Ekaterina Kondratova](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-269887775/stock-photo-fresh-raw-ground-beef-on-a-paper-on-a-rustic-wooden-table.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nGround beef will typically last up to two days, if it’s kept in its original store packaging. If you are not going to use it right away, you should put it in the freezer. Wrap the package with freezer paper, plastic wrap or heavy-duty aluminum foil before storing. This will prevent freezer burn, which is common for foods that are frozen for lengthy periods of time. You can keep the meat in your freezer for up to four months. Thawed meat should be used within two days.\r\n\r\n### Fish\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4206\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![fish](/posts/shutterstock_355479440.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4206\">[timolina](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-355479440/stock-photo-raw-salmon-steak-and-vegetables-for-cooking-on-a-light-wooden-background-in-a-rustic-style-top-view.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nLike ground beef, fish will last up to two days when stored in the main body of your refrigerator. Freeze your fish if you aren’t going to use it right away and make sure to freeze it before the two-day time period is up. This is especially important for shell-fish. For best results, keep the fish in its original store packaging and overwrap it with airtight plastic wrap, freezer paper or heavy-duty aluminum foil. You can store fish for up to 8 months in your freezer.\r\n\r\n### White Bread\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4207\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![white bread](/posts/shutterstock_352819853.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4207\">[Gamzova_Olga](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-352819853/stock-photo-sliced-white-bread.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCommercially-baked, pre-sliced white bread typically lasts up to 7 days before it shows signs of molding. To achieve the best results, keep your bread tightly closed in its original packaging and store it at room temperature. Avoid storing it in the refrigerator because it will grow dry and stale. You can freeze any unused bread for up to 3 months.\r\n\r\n### Commercially Canned or Bottled Black Beans\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4208\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![beans](/posts/shutterstock_168790814.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4208\">[Gayvoronskaya_Yana](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-168790814/stock-photo-black-bean-in-bowl.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCanned beans typically have a shelf life between 2 and 5 years. For best results, remove any cans that are rusting, bulging, leaking or severely dented. Store them in a cool, dry place, such as your pantry. In most cases, the unopened beans will still be safe to eat after the “Use By” or “Best By” date on the label has expired. The color or texture of the beans may change, but you can still eat them if you have stored them properly.\r\n\r\n### Peanut Butter\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4209\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![peanut butter](/posts/shutterstock_316086323.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4209\">[inewsfoto](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-316086323/stock-photo-creamy-peanut-butter-on-wood-table-selective-focus.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAn unopened jar of peanut butter wil  \r\nl last up to 2 years, if stored in a cool, dry place. An opened jar will last up to 3 months in the pantry. You should store it in the refrigerator after that time has passed to help prevent oil separation and preserve the peanut butter’s flavor. The expiration labels represent the quality of the product. If you find that the label is expired, check the peanut butter for mold, odor or any indication that it has spoiled. If you don’t find any of these things, it should still be safe to eat.\r\n\r\n### Un-refrigerated Apple Juice\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4210\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4210\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![un-refrigerated apple juice](/posts/shutterstock_204835342.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4210\">[Markus_Mainka](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-204835342/stock-photo-apple-juice-pouring-from-red-apples-fruits-in-summer-into-a-glass.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBottled or canned apple juice will last up to 18 months, when stored in a cool, dry area, such as your pantry. In most cases, the juice will be safe to drink after the expiration date has passed, although it may lose some of its flavor. You can freeze the juice by placing it in an airtight plastic or glass container with at least half an inch of headspace at the top. This will allow for the expansion that occurs when the juice freezes. You can keep the apple juice in your freezer for up to a year.\r\n\r\n### Fresh, Whole Avocados\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4211\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4211\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![avacado](/posts/shutterstock_262583882.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4211\">[ami_mataraj](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-262583882/stock-photo-a-fresh-avocado-cut-in-half-on-wood.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt takes between 4 to 7 days for an avocado to ripen. Then it will yield when you give it a gentle squeeze. Once it is ripe, place it in a plastic bag and put it in the refrigerator. There, it should last up to 5 days. You can freeze avocados by pureeing them with lemon juice and putting the puree into an air-tight container or heavy-duty freezer bag. The puree will last for up to 6 months in the freezer.\r\n\r\n### Fresh, Whole Cantaloupe Melons\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4212\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4212\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![cantalope](/posts/shutterstock_306772649.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4212\">[Yellow Cat](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-306772649)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPlace the melons in your pantry or another cool, dry place until they ripen. This takes between 2-4 days. Then place them in the refrigerator, where they will last up to 10 days. Cantaloupe freezes well. Simply cut the melons in half, remove their seeds and rinds. Slice, cube or ball the melon and place the pieces in a covered airtight container. A heavy-duty freezer bag will also work.\r\n\r\n### Fresh, Raw Broccoli\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4213\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4213\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![fresh raw brocolli](/posts/shutterstock_325389908.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4213\">[JIANG_HONGYAN](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-325389908/stock-photo-broccoli-vegetable-on-white-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBroccoli will keep well for up to 5 days, when stored in the refrigerator. Keep in in a plastic bag and do not wash until you are ready to use it. You can freeze broccoli for up to 18 months. To do this, cut off the woody stems and leaves. Split the stalks and flowerets into 1.5-inch pieces. Plunge the pieces into boiling water for three minutes, then chill quickly in ice water. Drain off the excess water and package in freezer bags or airtight containers. Freeze immediately.\r\n\r\n### Fresh, Raw Carrots\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4214\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4214\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![fresh raw carrot](/posts/shutterstock_250834906.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4214\">[Ekaterina_Kondratova](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-250834906/stock-photo-fresh-carrots-bunch-on-rustic-wooden-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou can store fresh, raw carrots in your refrigerator for up to 4 weeks. Store them in a plastic bag and put them in the vegetable crisper of your refrigerator. You can freeze carrots for up to 18 months. Follow the same procedure as you would for broccoli.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about how to store and freeze other foods that weren’t mentioned, visit [StillTasty](https://www.stilltasty.com/searchitems/search_page).\r\n"

Paying for such a huge expense early on in life can have a crippling effect on a person’s financial well-being for the rest of his or her life. This is especially true if he or she will have to take out loans to pay for college.\r\n\r\n### College loans last forever\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4285\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4285\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![college loans last forever](/posts/shutterstock_149471900.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4285\">[zimmytws](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-149471900/stock-photo-graduation-cap-and-money-on-a-diploma.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFew people realize until it’s too late that they cannot escape paying off their college debt. There is virtually no way to discharge these debts in bankruptcy courts. That means your child will have to pay on those loans for the rest of his or her life. Even if he or she is unemployed or sick, the student loans have to be paid. Few 18 year-olds can really understand that burden.\r\n\r\n### Degrees don’t get you a job\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4286\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4286\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![degrees don't get you a job](/posts/shutterstock_70576168.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4286\">[foto_ARts](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-70576168/stock-photo-senior-manager-rejecting-job-applicant.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, employers want to know what you can do, not what kind of degree you have. Already, too many college graduates are discovering that their degrees, particularly outside of technical fields such as Engineering, do not make them more appealing to recruiters. That means they have the burden of college loans and no job.\r\n\r\n### Four years is a long time\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4287\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![four years is a long time](/posts/shutterstock_130799282-e1478033936882.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4287\">[ghenadie](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-130799282/stock-vector-calendar-with-flying-pages-with-years-on-them.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe time commitment for a college degree is rarely discussed, but it’s worth pointing out that getting one takes at least four years. During that time, a student’s earning potential is pretty much limited to part-time jobs. Using those years to learn a trade while getting paid to work, on the other hand, can have a much bigger pay-off.\r\n\r\n### There are plenty of good jobs that don’t require college\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4288\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4288\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![there are plenty of good jobs that dont require college](/posts/shutterstock_359798642.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4288\">[Dmitry_Kalinovsky](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-359798642/stock-photo-electrician-works-with-electric-meter-tester-in-fuse-box.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSkilled tradesman and women are in high demand in pretty much all sectors of the economy. Knowing how to weld, fit pipe, or run a lathe are skills that fewer people have, and they’re not taught in most colleges. Furthermore, these are skills that allow someone to work in a variety of different settings. That means that when one area of the economy is down, they can find a job in another sector.\r\n\r\n### Dropping out of college is worse than never going at all\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4289\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4289\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![dropping out of college is worse than never going at all](/posts/shutterstock_363589958-e1478036831511.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4289\">[igor_kisselev](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-363589958/stock-vector--school-dropout-standing-with-people-in-graduation-caps.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf your child is on the fence about going to school, point out that if he or she decides to quit halfway through, it will mean that he or she will still have to pay back the college loans they took out. Only now, they’ll have to do it without the benefit of a college degree. People in this situation account for the highest number of lion defaults.\r\n\r\n### Many successful people never finished college\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4290\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4290\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![many successful people dont finish college](/posts/shutterstock_352156898.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4290\">[sergey_nivens](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-352156898/stock-photo-close-up-of-businessman-hand-showing-key-to-success.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of inventors and business owners who never went to or quit college before they got a degree. Many of these people were highly motivated to start a business or do something other than sit in a classroom. If your child just doesn’t have the patience for school, then it makes more sense to support him or her in some other way.\r\n\r\n### College may take more than four years\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4291\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![college can take more than 4 years](/posts/shutterstock_69584401.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4291\">[oneword](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-69584401/stock-photo-an-asian-woman-sitting-at-a-desk-watching-the-clock.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf your child isn’t sure what he or she wants to study, then college is one of the most expensive ways to figure it out. Taking classes for several years until deciding on a major will cost tens of thousands of dollars and eat up a lot of time that could be spent earning an income. If your child isn’t sure what he or she wants to do, tell him or her to work for a temp agency where they can try a lot of different jobs while earning money, not spending it.\r\n\r\n### Very few degrees pay more than vocational training\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4292\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4292\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![very few degrees pay more than vocational training](/posts/shutterstock_145333909.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4292\">[goodluz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-145333909/stock-photo-teacher-with-students-in-mechanics-working-on-bike.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDespite what the glossy college brochures imply, most college graduates don’t earn more money than people who work in a skilled trade. This is particularly true for liberal arts majors, who often find jobs in low-wage public sector work. Many people who have these degrees with they had chosen something else.\r\n\r\n### Work experience can bring down the costs of college\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4293\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![work experience can bring down the cost of college](/posts/shutterstock_210347026.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4293\">[pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-210347026/stock-photo-young-business-partners-sharing-ideas-and-planning-work-at-meeting-in-office.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMany schools will offer college credit for industry experience. In some cases, several years of work can replace a semester or two of courses. That can save a student a lot of money over the long-run.\r\n\r\n### Your child will have more freedom\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4294\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4294\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![your child will have more freedom](/posts/shutterstock_304958372.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4294\">[melpomene](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-304958372/stock-photo-education-debt-them-with-textbooks-piggy-bank-and-chalkboard-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nA college degree means graduating with a high level of debt. That means having to find a job that can pay off those loans. Without a degree, however, it’s possible to work and save for a few years, then take the time to travel or start a business. Not having to pay back loans is freedom to do what you want.\r\n\r\n### College classes don’t prepare you for a job\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4295\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4295\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![college classes don't prepare you for a job](/posts/shutterstock_269124671.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4295\">[billion_photos](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-269124671/stock-photo-paper-stack-paperwork.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile you may learn a lot, most graduates say they barely use what they learned in college at their job.\r\n\r\n### You can get started on your life earlier\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4296\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![you can get started on your life earlier](/posts/shutterstock_174760679.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4296\">[pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-174760679/stock-photo-group-of-business-partners-looking-astonishingly-at-laptop-display-at-meeting.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nInstead of devoting years to getting an education and then paying for it, your child can start pursuing their interests the minute he or she graduates from high school.

The vehicle is running off of the Ford designs that went with the sale of the company, yet resale values of this vehicle do drop off substantially after just a single year. Jaguar’s have never faired terribly well on the resale market due to major mechanical issues, which has frightened many away from the luxury vehicle (you’ll find this is a common thread for most luxury vehicles). With a first year drop off of nearly 32 percent, this vehicle just makes it outside of the top 10.\r\n\r\n### Cadillac CTS\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4232\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4232\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![cadillac cts](/posts/shutterstock_259417373.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4232\">[jia_li](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-259417373/stock-photo-geneva-mar-3-2016-cadillac-cts-v-presented-at-the-85th-international-motor-show-in-geneva-switzerland-on-march-3-2015.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe Cadillac CTS is the automaker’s flagship vehicle. With the recent design, the mid sized sedan continues to turn heads and compete with other luxury vehicles on the market. However, it also has a substantial financial drop off. After just one year, the vehicle drops a full 34 percent. This reflects in the resale value, but it also means you can land a one year old CTS for a third off the original price tag.\r\n\r\n### Kia Optima\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4233\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4233\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![kia optima](/posts/shutterstock_87117274.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4233\">[tumar](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-87117274/stock-photo-minsk-september-24-kia-optima-on-display-at-the-minsk-2011-motorshow-an-international-auto-exhibition-on-september-24-2011-in-minsk-belarus.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nKia vehicles already start at a reduced price tag over most of the competition, which is one of its major selling points. However, the amount of money you land back when trying to sell is considerably low than most of the competition. While there are many reasons behind this (the market for resale Kia vehicles just is not high), the drastic drop off of 35 percent places it squarely in the top 10 of vehicles with terrible resale value.\r\n\r\n### Mitsubishi Lancer\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4234\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4234\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![mitsubshi lancer](/posts/shutterstock_98693408.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4234\">[Chatchai_Somwat](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-98693408/stock-photo-bangkok-march-27-mitsubishi-lancer-ex-car-on-display-at-the-33th-bangkok-international-motor-show-on-march-27-2012-in-bangkok-thailand.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMitsubishi has dropped off a bit in recent years. It no longer has the massive production as other auto manufacturers. The Mitsubishi Lancer remains one of the company’s top sellers though. With a 35 percent drop off after the first year, it does make the vehicle less desirable to buy. Some of the crossover SUVs the company recently released are helping make up for this, but it is not good for the Mitsubishi auto manufacturer.\r\n\r\n### Chevrolet Express\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4243\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4243\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Chevrolet express](/posts/shutterstock_355320815.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4243\">[Konovalov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-355320815/stock-photo-moscow-russia-june-2-2013-motor-car-chevrolet-express-at-the-city-street.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou may have never heard of the time, but you’ve probably seen the vehicle before. It is a cargo van, often without windows. It tends to make an appearance in most spy, kidnapping or action movies. While this really isn’t a consumer vehicle, it is heavily used by small businesses. The main reason the vehicle has a low resale value (a drop of 37 percent) is because most people hold onto these vehicles for longer, and those who do buy want something new and now several years old with heavy miles on it.\r\n\r\n### VW Beetle\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4236\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4236\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![VW beetle](/posts/shutterstock_365337815-1.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4236\">[darren_brode](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-365337815/stock-photo-detroit-january-12-a-volkswagen-beetle-convertible-on-display-at-the-north-american-international-auto-show-media-preview-january-12-2016-in-detroit-michigan.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe Beetle has a very niche audience. Due to the design it isn’t something that attracts a wide audience. It is something you either really like and will purchase, or you don’t like it at all and wouldn’t touch it. Because of this, the resale value drops off after one year by 37 percent. It does have some nice handling and performance features, which are found in other VW manufactured offerings, but it also has extreme blind spots, which can turn off even those curious about the vehicle.\r\n\r\n### Hyundai Genesis\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4237\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4237\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![hyundai-genesis](/posts/shutterstock_246350503.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4237\">[darren_brode](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-246350503/stock-photo-detroit-january-15-the-hyundai-genesis-coupe-on-display-january-15th-2015-at-the-2015-north-american-international-auto-show-in-detroit-michigan.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nHyundai has been attempting to promote itself as a luxury brand for a while now, but it hasn’t really caught on. This is a difficult market to break into, as most players have been well established for a long time. BMW, Lexus, Cadillac, all have familiar names and with it repeat buyers. Steaming shoppers away from these other brands has proven difficult, which is why the Hyundai Genesis is struggling. It also is why the resale value drops off by 38 percent after one year. Used car buyers tend to not look towards Hyundai. Another reason is used luxury vehicles typically do not have a long shelf life. These vehicles are made for people who buy the vehicle and will trade it in after a few years, not for someone who wants it (typically) for a decade.\r\n\r\n### Chevrolet Camaro\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4238\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4238\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![chevrolet camero](/posts/shutterstock_207751075.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4238\">[everything](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-207751075/stock-photo-singapore-june-25-2014-new-design-chevrolet-camaro-from-transformers3-to-audience-in-universal-studios-june-25-2014-singapore.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe muscle competition is back, and while the Camaro has done fine in sales, it still is unable to compete with the Ford Mustang. Plus, most who want this vehicle tend to look towards the brand new releases (even though design wise the shapes are not all that different). With the stark competition, the massive blind spots and the desire to always buy new, the Chevrolet [Camaro](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2016/01/08/new-cars-that-suffer-the-worst-resale-values/#73fe5423360f) has a 39 percent depreciation value after just one year.\r\n\r\n### Mercedes Benz SL Class\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4239\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4239\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![mercedes-benz-sl-class](/posts/shutterstock_227894839.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4239\">[Art_Konovalov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-227894839/stock-photo-saint-tropez-france-august-3-2014-black-sports-car-mercedes-benz-r231-sl-class-at-the-city-street.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis really is the cost of buying a luxury vehicle. The resale value just isn’t there. It is like buying a Tiffany diamond. Yes, you pay a pretty penny for it and the quality is typically superior, but when you go to sell it the price is even with options people paid substantially less for. With this SL Class, you can expect to see a 41 percent depreciation value after only one year. This means the $84,000 price tag drops to around $52,000 after a single year. While not great news for those who want to upgrade their own vehicle every few years, it is fantastic news for those who are willing to wait a year or two.\r\n\r\n### Dodge Charger\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4240\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4240\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![dodge charger](/posts/shutterstock_387605164.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4240\">[darren_brode](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-387605164/stock-photo-chicago-february-12-the-2017-dodge-charger-hellcat-on-display-at-the-chicago-auto-show-media-preview-february-12-2016-in-chicago-illinois.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis full sized muscle car comes with a massive engine and can out perform just about any other vehicle in its class. However, the full sized sedan market is starting to move over to the crossover vehicles as the crossovers offer more space and more leg room. While many crossover SUVs are unable to compete with the engine under the Charger’s hood, this sedan sees a first year depreciation drop off of 45 percent.\r\n\r\n### Nissan Leaf\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4241\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4241\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![nissan leaf](/posts/shutterstock_249344869.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4241\">[darren_brode](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-249344869/stock-photo-detroit-january-15-the-nissan-leaf-on-display-january-15th-2015-at-the-2015-north-american-international-auto-show-in-detroit-michigan.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nNow this is an electric car that simply has not fared well at all. The major problem with the vehicle is that it is both all electric and the driving distance is substantially short. It is more of a local commuter car than anything else. Because of this, the market for a used Leaf vehicle is low. Most people who are looking to buy an electric vehicle want something newer with updated technology (like buying a brand new phone over a phone that is a year or two old). With a 48 percent drop off after one year, you can go out and purchase the used vehicle for almost half the price.\r\n"

With such a card you can start to earn airline miles and save money towards buying a ticket. If you grab a card now, in a few years you might have enough points to pay for the flight completely. Even if you want to take a trip at the end of the year, every little bit helps.\r\n\r\n### Couch Surf\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4548\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4548\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![couch surf travel tips](/posts/372.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4548\">[Syda_Productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-307340372/stock-photo-people-rest-comfort-and-leisure-concept-african-american-young-woman-sleeping-on-sofa-at-home.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou’ve probably heard of Airbnb, which is a nice alternative to hotels, but it has reached a point where it isn’t saving you all that much money. It just puts you in a residential home. You can try to go with a hostel, in some places works out well, yet even then you might end up spending too much. Instead, sign up for a Couch Surf account. This is free and it introduces you to people around the world who are willing to let you sleep on their couch for free. it’s a great way to meet people and it really helps save you some money. Now, it generally only works when traveling on your own (it may work as a pair, depending on the location), but it’s hard to beat a free night stay. It is nice to toss a few dollars to the person for their time or using their shower, but even so, it’s a great deal.\r\n\r\n### Museum Card\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4549\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4549\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![museum card travel tips](/posts/276.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4549\">[Comaniciu Dan](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/women-sitting-on-bench-art-gallery-154949276)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you are planning on visiting museums when visiting a certain location, look ahead of time to see if there is a museum card. Typically (especially in Europe and the United States) cities have museum cards. You pay a discounted rate and can get into these different museums whenever you want for a set period of time.\r\n\r\n### Money Exchange\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4550\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4550\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![money exchange travel tips](/posts/971.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4550\">[Firma V](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-woman-man-clothes-shop-over-250571971?src=GEe5vN2fl0TckZqMJ1Ob8g-1-95)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou may feel inclined to exchange a large amount of money in the airport before hitting the streets. Avoid doing this. Money exchange within the airport is usually the most expensive location to do this. Take out just what you need for a day or so and then stop at a money exchange location near where you’ll be staying. You’ll receive better rates and it will help you save some cash along the way.\r\n\r\n### Foreign Charges\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4551\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4551\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![foreign charges travel tips](/posts/946.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4551\">[Syda Productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/people-holidays-tourism-travel-sale-concept-448374946?src=ZZqWrMtdiCQEjFk0_0YMVA-1-1)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nShopping with a credit card while traveling is the way to go. It gives you protection a debit or cash just doesn’t provide. Plus, it is safer to travel with. However, many cards charge an international fee when shopping overseas. Instead, look around for credit cards that don’t charge the international charges. Most travel cards offer you this option, but look around and you’ll save money.\r\n\r\n### Earn that Extra Cash\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4552\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4552\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![earn extra cash travel tips](/posts/914.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4552\">[Rica Photography](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/businessman-communicating-via-internet-isolated-on-146559914?src=Gj5F82QRrA0YrB0kWa9LSQ-1-63)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPutting some extra cash away towards your vacation will help you enjoy that trip of a lifetime. How can you do this though? Sign up for services like Ebates. It is a free sights that gives you cash back when shopping with thousands of retailers online. This is free money back into your account. If you shop a good amount online you can earn a few hundred dollars by the end of the year, which can go a long way on your trip.\r\n\r\n### The Flight Deal\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4553\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4553\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![flight deal travel tips](/posts/064.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4553\">[RossHelen](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/elegant-business-couple-baggage-getting-on-595303064)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFlightdeal.com is one the best website for flight and hotel deals. Often times hotels and airlines have to quickly sell flights so there are flash sales (or even errors). Flight Deal scours hundreds of sites and posts updated buying information. You need to move fast on these listings as most only last for a day or two before sold out, but if you want to save a good amount of money, this is where to go.\r\n\r\n### Free International Calling\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4554\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4554\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![free international calling travel tips](/posts/034.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4554\">[Robert Neumann](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-blond-woman-called-her-smartphone-114582034)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nKeeping in contact with people back home is expensive if you don’t know where to turn. T-Mobile offers free international roaming in many locations. If you don’t have T-Mobile check out Google’s Project Fi.\r\n\r\n### Skyline Mile Rewards\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4555\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4555\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![skyline mileage rewards travel tips](/posts/396.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4555\">[Minerva Studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/couple-toasting-wineglasses-luxury-restaurant-focus-420835396?src=hIPPbiPJeYeLaA0Er8i91w-1-17)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSign up for the skyline miles for the airlines you’re looking at. Then, sign up for their reward programs, which can include dining at restaurants or shopping at certain stores. You connect a credit card and then receive airline miles for purchases. This is another way to chip away at that final cost.\r\n\r\n### Ditch the Rental Insurance\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4556\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4556\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ditch rental insurance travel tips](/posts/1022.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4556\">[g-stockstudio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-218931022/stock-photo-enjoying-road-trip-together-beautiful-young-couple-enjoying-road-trip-in-their-convertible-and.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCheck with your credit card. You likely already have rental insurance. No need to pay for it twice.\r\n\r\n### Know the Taxi Situation\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4557\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4557\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![taxi travel tips](/posts/154.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4557\">[BravoKiloVideo](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-female-business-woman-hail-cab-509994154?src=oU9Lfdd-j14_ikanmoRBOg-1-94)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen traveling to a foreign country, you may be taken for an expensive ride. Know the taxi situation ahead of time. For example, if you step out of the airport in Bangkok you’ll end up being quoted an expensive price, but if you look for a metered taxi, you’ll pay a fraction of it. Even in the U.S. this happens. Step out of the airport in Las Vegas, taxi drivers will ask if you want to take the freeway to the strip or your hotel. Sounds faster, so most say yes, but this is significantly more expensive than the other option as it is longer. Know your taxi situation before hand.\r\n\r\n### Rewards Transfer Bonus\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4558\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4558\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![reward transfer bonus travel tips](/posts/724.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4558\">[Blend Images](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/couple-on-vacation-leaving-airplane-632989724?src=GMIMf8yscfsFY87EAkrxcQ-1-16)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMany travel reward credit cards provide mile transfer bonuses (such as converting your points with a 40% bonus over to a certain airline). Take advantage of this. You’ll nab that flight faster and cheaper.\r\n\r\n### Ditch the Checked Bags\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4559\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4559\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ditch checked bags travel tips](/posts/049.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4559\">[guruXOX](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/happy-tourists-holding-tickets-holiday-445725049?src=3ON7Nsneis2J5B2Sdi3QJA-1-40)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nChecking bags is expensive. Pack light and ditch the bags. You’ll save hundreds.\r\n\r\n### Travel Off-Season\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4560\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4560\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![travel off season travel tips](/posts/795.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4560\">[altafulla](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-114133795/stock-photo-happy-autumn-fall-couple-showing-with-outstretched-arms.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf possible, travel off season. Flights and hotels are discounted and will go for far less.\r\n\r\n### Book in Advance\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4561\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4561\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![book in advance travel tips](/posts/282.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4561\">[dotshock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-beautiful-couple-bathrobes-enjoying-morning-628805282?src=BNItBl6TtCJ1fgQSSwOiNw-1-66)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe longer you wait, the more expensive it will be. So look to book your accommodations when you know about when and where you want to travel.\r\n"

Even luck needs hard work thrown into the mix. For example, approximately 44 percent of lottery winners blow through their winnings within five years because they fail to see that they need to work hard to keep their winnings intact.\r\n\r\nSuccessful business owners are not “born” entrepreneurs. They have worked hard to consistently outsell their competitors to provide their customers what they need or want.\r\n\r\n### Let Your Passion(s) Motivate You\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4250\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![i will help as many people as i can today](/posts/shutterstock_407325712.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4250\">[antonio_guillem](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-407325712/stock-photo-businesspeople-smiling-coworking-commenting-and-showing-growth-graphic-and-taking-a-business.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMillionaires typically pursue their passions without a no-fear attitude and self-motivation. Of course, they have the money to recoup if their venture fails. But don’t let this risk stop you from achieving your goals. Pursue your passions with zeal and enthusiasm. Develop a strong business plan and get some financial backers for your organization. Sites such as Kickstarter can help you get the money you need for your project.\r\n\r\nYou may have one passion or multiple passions that you enjoy. Figure out how to combine them so that you can produce something innovative for the public or a particular industry.\r\n\r\n### Learn to Live Below Your Means\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4033\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4033\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![save your change credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_244678267.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4033\">[Steven_Frame](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244678267/stock-photo-man-drops-money-into-a-glass-jar-for-a-savings-account.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMany of us are guilty of impulse buying. Some of us may have 401Ks or other retirement savings, but many people live from paycheck to paycheck. Read “The Bucket System Savings Strategy,” plus how-to books to get and stay out of debt and build a financial cushion for yourself.\r\n\r\n### Diversify Income Streams\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4486\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4486\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Diversify Income Streams millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_393378790.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4486\">[andrey_poppov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-393378790/stock-photo-young-female-stock-market-broker-looking-at-graphs-on-multiple-computers-in-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou’ve heard the saying, ‘Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.’ Millionaires follow this rule, too. They have multiple sources of income, although they may focus on one area, such as real estate or finance, and develop several strategies that will keep their cashflow coming on a consistent basis.\r\n\r\nFor example, let’s say that you are passionate about digital illustration. How many different sources of income can this passion produce? There are many places that you can sell your art online. You can also write a how-to book or register as an instructor on education sites such as Udemy.\r\n\r\nHow many different sources of income can your passion produce? Take a moment and think about it. Write down any ideas that come to mind and research them to see if they are viable.\r\n\r\n### Never Stop Learning\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4487\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4487\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![never stop learning millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_284651963.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4487\">[sergey_nivens](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-284651963/stock-photo-elderly-lady-working-with-laptop.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMillionaires always keep abreast of the latest trends that concern their passions. According to Tom Corley, author of “Rich Habits: The Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals,” 85 percent of millionaires read at least two books every month. They read books that help promote their professional growth.\r\n\r\nYou can do the same, but it’s also a good idea to find books that are related to your passion. If you don’t enjoy reading, you can keep your learning up to date by listening to audio books during your daily commute. Also take advantage of the free or cheap online education resources that are out there. Join Facebook groups and forums to stay current.\r\n\r\n### Network With Successful People\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4488\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4488\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![network with successful people millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_180793232.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4488\">[rawpixel.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-180793232/stock-photo-group-of-diverse-business-people-in-office-building.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDepending on what your passion is, you will find at least one network that has successful members. Invest your time and energy building friendships with those people. Figure out what’s important to them and offer to help out whenever they need it.\r\n\r\nJoin a mastermind group and/or attend seminars that require you to participate. Always follow through with whatever task this group needs to accomplish to succeed in a goal.\r\n\r\n### Find A Mentor\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4489\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4489\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![find a mentor millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_218537689.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4489\">[racorn](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-218537689/stock-photo-two-young-businesswomen-having-a-meeting-in-the-office-sitting-at-a-desk-having-a-discussion-with.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nA mentor is someone who has a wealth or experience and knowledge about the passion you are pursuing. When first starting out, it is easy to make costly mistakes. Your mentor can not only help you avoid the common (and not so common) pitfalls that can cost you a lot of time and money, but he or she can also provide invaluable feedback and encouragement.\r\n\r\n### Model Psychological and Physical Traits\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4490\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4490\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Psychological and Physical Traits millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_93687307.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4490\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-93687307/stock-photo-close-up-of-smiling-businessman-with-his-mentor-behind-him-against-a-white-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMillionaires think, feel and act differently than average people. Observe the way they carry themselves, the way they speak and what they talk about. Learn what values are important to them.\r\n\r\nCompared to the average American, millionaires don’t give up easily when faced with a tough problem. They are also more disciplined with their finances and more alert for new opportunities.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have direct access to a millionaire, you can still learn a lot about the person through the interviews they have given, social media activities and books they may have written.\r\n\r\n### Create Clear, Sustainable Goals\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4491\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4491\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![create clear and sustainable goals millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_118796125.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4491\">[jenn_huls](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-118796125/stock-photo-person-writing-goals-on-a-paper.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMillionaires establish very clear goals and priorities to help them stay focused. They are more than willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. They work both hard and smart and spend a considerable amount of time analyzing whether their actions are helping them to achieve those goals. Ditch goals that create short-term happiness with no long-term benefits.\r\n\r\n### Avoid Time Wasters\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4493\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4493\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![avoid time wasters millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_326098871.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4493\">[andrey_poppov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-326098871/stock-photo-close-up-of-person-hands-with-mobile-phone-and-list-of-work-in-diary.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAvoid time wasters such as TV and the Internet. Approximately seventy-seven percent of people who struggle financially spend at least an hour a day watching television or surfing the web for useless endeavors. Ditch the television altogether or set aside one night a week to watch a favorite show. When you go online, use this time to pursue your goals instead of watching funny cat videos or playing Facebook games. Use Facebook and other social media sites to network with other people who share your passions.\r\n\r\n### Reclaim Ownership Of Your Time\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4492\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4492\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![reclaim ownership of your time millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_107377481.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4492\">[fotohunter](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-107377481/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-businessman-holding-a-clock-against-blue-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTime management is vital if you want to be successful. If you are weak in this area, read some books or go to a seminar on the subject. Learn how to manage your time so that you will be successful in whatever you decide to do.\r\n\r\nMany people use a day planner or time management software to keep them on track. If your list is long and anxiety-provoking, try breaking the list down into smaller blocks. For instance, you can set up times when you will check your email. Set up another block of time when you will market your product or service.\r\n\r\n### Learn to Ask For Help\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4494\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4494\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ask for help millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_95466664.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4494\">[rido](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-95466664/stock-photo-smiling-business-colleagues-working-together-during-a-meeting-in-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMany of us were conditioned as children that asking for help is a sign of weakness or incompetence. Ditch that attitude and learn to ask for help, when needed. Outsource mundane tasks or tasks which you have no experience in doing (such as web design or social media marketing) to people who do these for a living. Fiverr, Upwork and other freelance sites have many capable people who can help you do these tasks.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Give Into Your Fears And Doubts\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4495\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4495\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Don't give into your fears and doubts millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_296219069.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4495\">[st22studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-296219069/stock-photo-businessman-on-the-road-to-success-in-business.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFear can be a great motivator or it can crush you. The biggest fears of starting a new venture are fear of change, fear of making mistakes and fear of taking risks. You might be dealing with other fears. If so, address them and figure out a way to overcome them so that they don’t cripple you. Donald Trump wrote a book called, “Think Like a Champion”, where he explains how he uses The What If Game to silence his inner critics. Other ways to curb your anxiety is to set up a daily meditation or yoga session. If that doesn’t work, go for a walk or a jog.\r\n\r\n### Learn To Accept And Overcome Failure\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4496\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4496\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![overcome fear of failure and doubt millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_389143408.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4496\">[sergey_nivens](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-389143408/stock-photo-make-your-income-grow.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMillionaires have great faith in their dreams, even when others don’t support what they set out to do. They realize that failure is a part of growth because it provides valuable feedback on what works and what doesn’t.\r\n\r\nThe best way to avoid failure is to learn how to ask questions and ask for help when you need it. If you do fail, despite all of your well-planned efforts, take it as a learning experience and make a decision whether you want to continue with this path or try something else.\r\n\r\n### Take Control Of Your Own Destiny\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4497\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4497\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![take control of your own destiny millionaires](/posts/shutterstock_171682469.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4497\">[rangizzz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-171682469/stock-photo-king-of-the-world-young-successful-businessman-in-front-of-the-city-at-night.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nRandom luck has nothing to do with whether or not you succeed in an endeavor. Luck may be a factor in your success, but it will be from opportunity. This “Opportunity Good Luck” is based on habits, hard work and persistence. Never give up, even when you fail (and you will at least once).\r\n"

With the average media base salary of $54,000 and the average home value of $137,500, is is both affordable and a great starting point for visiting other destinations throughout both the Midwest and Southeast\r\n\r\n### Kansas City, Missouri\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4460\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4460\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Kansas City](/posts/shutterstock_238389709.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4460\">  \r\n[Tupungato](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/kansas-city-usa-june-25-2013-238389709)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nKansas City is a larger city that can surprise most visitors. It has a mixture of both the Rust Belt vibe of the Midwest and Northeast with a very down home feel to it as well. With a median base salary of $58,000 and the average cost of a home sitting at $147,500, there are both city and small down amenities available here.\r\n\r\n### Birmingham, Alabama\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4459\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4459\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Birmingham](/posts/shutterstock_232232023.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4459\">  \r\n[ESB Professional](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/birmingham-alabama-usa-downtown-skyline-232232023)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFor a taste of the south, Birmingham is one of the larger cities found in the deep south.

Plus, as the average home costs around $128,000, it is a fantastic place to buy a home and raise a family.\r\n\r\n### Cincinnati, Ohio\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4462\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4462\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Cincinnati](/posts/shutterstock_551329018.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4462\">[Brad J Mitchell](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/suspension-bridge-cincinnati-ohio-sunrise-551329018)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nLocated right where Ohio and Kentucky connect with a close proximity to West Virginia and Indiana, Cincinnati is the perfect spot for anyone who loves a road trip to just about anywhere. It has large city vibes mixed with more rural options as well. This makes it great for those who love professional sports teams yet want a down home cooked meal as well. With an average salary of $57,179 and an average home value of $143,4000, it is a solid Midwestern town.\r\n\r\n### St. Louis, Missouri\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4464\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4464\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![St. Louis](/posts/shutterstock_554033449.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4464\">[SNEHIT](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/saint-louis-mo-usa-april-28-554033449)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSt. Louis provides plenty of history without costing a bundle. The average salary is $56,896 and the median home value is $141,900. While in the same state as Kansas City, it provides a completely different feel, so checking out either city is possible.\r\n\r\n### Indianapolis, Indiana\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4466\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4466\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Indianapolis](/posts/shutterstock_569160187.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4466\">  \r\n[Rudy Balasko](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/indianapolis-cityscape-image-downtown-indiana-during-569160187)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is a staple Midwestern city. With an average salary of $56,000 and a average home value of $130,200, Indianapolis is an extremely affordable location. It also hosts a large share of college and professional sporting events, for those who love sports.\r\n\r\n### Cleveland, Ohio\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4465\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4465\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Cleveland](/posts/shutterstock_558350902.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4465\">[Henryk Sadura](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/cleveland-skyline-night-ohio-usa-558350902)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCleveland is a classic Rust Belt city. It shares many similarities with another city on this list, Detroit. With historic buildings and a great professional sports offering, Cleveland is a great place to call home, as long as snow can be appreciated. With a median salary of $55,000 and an average home value of $125,500, it is an affordable town as well.\r\n\r\n### Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4463\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4463\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Pittsburgh](/posts/shutterstock_552042799.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4463\">[Tupungato](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/pittsburgh-skyline-552042799)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe “Burgh” is a great town to call home. With both passionate sports fans and locals who love the town, Pittsburgh is more than just a manufacturing city. It is a location with a large number of jobs and affordable housing. The median salary is just under $57,000 and the average home value is $126,700.\r\n\r\n### Memphis, Tennessee\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4461\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4461\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Memphis](/posts/shutterstock_519194572.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4461\">  \r\n[f11photo](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/aerial-view-downtown-memphis-skyline-tennessee-519194572)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFor anyone who likes to position themselves between the Southeast and the Midwest, Tennessee is the place to be. Memphis offers some of the least expensive housing options on this list with the average home value of $112,100. Put along side the average base salary of $52,000, it is an excellent location to call home. Plus, with so much music history, it is hard to go wrong with Memphis.\r\n\r\n### Detroit, Michigan\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4468\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4468\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Detroit](/posts/shutterstock_578781955.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4468\">  \r\n[JHVEPhoto](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/detroit-usa-june-17-2016-view-578781955)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDetroit has been through a lot but the renaissance the city is going through is truly amazing. With incredible architecture and one of the best spots venues in the country, there is much to fall in love with about Detroit. Plus, it is also home to Motown. With one of the highest average salaries of $61,500 and the average home value of $123,100 money does go farther in Detroit. With all the developing going on in Detroit, it is important to invest quickly though as property values are sure to rise in the next few years.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nAuto dealerships have been forced to reduce prices of current inventory to unprecedented levels. If you are in the market for a new SUV or car, this just might be the best time to buy. Research the many different offers and you are sure to find a lovely new SUV, car or truck that makes financial sense for your unique budget.\r\n\r\n![](/posts/1080x1080_newcar_wrapped_ontrain.jpg)</div><div class=\"cta-textcover\">Unsold 2020 SUV Pricing</div>](#)</div>More importantly, this is a golden opportunity to buy or lease a new SUV that is comfortable, loaded with luxurious amenities and is a blast to drive. However, if you were to wait even a couple months, there is no guarantee these fantastic deals will still be available.\r\n\r\n## Why SUV Prices Have Dropped so Low\r\n\r\nSUVs have become more affordable in recent months due to several factors. The ongoing worldwide pandemic combined with cash-strapped consumers has led to historically low prices on select SUVs as well as other vehicles. Though most SUV-seekers are unaware of it, the truth is auto dealers are stuck with an abundance of unsold automobiles. These dealerships are attempting to clear out inventory in anticipation of the upcoming 2021 models. This is the perfect opportunity for internet users to land a gorgeous new SUV for a fraction of the regular cost.\r\n\r\nShifts in market demand combined with overproduction of SUVs has left auto dealers with an excess of inventory. This is a fairly rare situation that occurs every now and then yet might not arise again for several more years or even decades into the future. If you have been holding off on the purchase of your dream SUV, today is the day to pull the trigger on a purchase. From luxury SUVs with all sorts of fancy features and premium materials to regular SUVs without as many bells and whistles and beyond, there are countless low-cost options on the current market. Even some crossovers are priced at rock bottom prices that might not be seen again for multiple years or possibly even an entire decade or longer.\r\n\r\n## SUV Demand has Been Rising yet Supply is Even Higher\r\n\r\nIt is no secret the masses covet SUVs. Sedans, coupes, sports cars and other vehicle types are no longer en vogue. There is an ever-increasing demand for SUVs yet the market is overloaded with these vehicles, largely because auto dealers are aware that there is a seemingly insatiable demand for the vehicles. Furthermore, there is an abundance of used SUVs that are still relatively new with surprisingly few miles on the odometer. Add in the fact that automakers have dramatically ramped up the production of SUVs and there is even more reason for auto-seekers to act now, taking full advantage of these potentially once-in-a-lifetime low prices.\r\n\r\nAs an example, SUV-seekers should consider purchasing the Mazda CX-5, a vehicle available at a 0% interest rate across 60 months along with a $500 bonus with monthly payments as low as a mere $199<sup>1</sup>. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is another fantastic opportunity for those covering a SUV. Available with 0% for 60 months, the Cherokee also provides some icing on the metaphorical cake with a $3,000 bonus cashback award that lowers monthly payments to an affordable $269 per month<sup>2</sup>. Even the uber-popular Nissan Rogue is available at a surprisingly low $199 per month, a deal complete with a $500 bonus and 0% across 60 months<sup>3</sup>. Those on the prowl for a luxury SUV will immediately fall in love with the Acura RDX, an upscale vehicle available for a mere $379 per month<sup>4</sup>. If you have always dreamed of driving a BMW, now is the time to buy one. In particular, the BMW X3 is available for a mere $479 per month<sup>5</sup>.\r\n\r\n## Start Your Search Online\r\n\r\nThe days of walking into a brick-and-mortar auto dealership to buy a new SUV are quickly fading away. Nowadays, more buyers are turning to the internet to purchase a new SUV or other automobile. Perform a search for your new SUV on the web and you will learn all about the incentives provided by local auto dealers, finding it is quite easy to compare prices between models. Furthermore, there are plenty of exclusive online-only deals that cannot be found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## The Best Time to Buy is Now\r\n\r\n</div>The incredibly low SUV prices might not be available throughout the entirety of 2021. Seize the opportunity to buy or lease a new vehicle while prices are at record lows and you will rest easy knowing you made the best possible use of your car-buying budget. If you have been patiently waiting on the sidelines, now is the time to act. Keep in mind, it is only a matter of time until rates increase, making it that much more financially challenging to buy a new SUV. Get the ball rolling on your search right now, find the perfect new SUV for yourself and your family and you will enjoy an invaluable peace of mind knowing you landed the best possible deal.\r\n"

While it may be worded differently, you’ll almost always receive this kind of a question. Basically, your potential employer wants to understand you a little bit. It is also one question may applicants stumble over. Thankfully, you can practice it a bit (because it is so common). Create an elevator pitch. This is a two minute or so introduction to yourself. The elevator pitch idea works for just about everything (telling your boss about a new project, selling a story and so on). This way, you can keep it concise without missing out anything important. However, try not to simply repeat everything, word for word, by memory. You’ll sound like a machine. Rehearse your bullet points and everything will be fine.\r\n\r\n### What kind of salary are you looking for?\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4042\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4042\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![career help warren buffett](/posts/shutterstock_148377209.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4042\">[Dragon_Images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-148377209/stock-photo-close-up-image-of-a-thoughtful-businessman-with-chin-on-hand-against-a-grey-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is a tricky question. Say too much and you may price yourself out of a job. Say too little and you’ll be underpaid. Don’t just ballpark a number though. Do your research. Look into what the average is for someone in the position you’re applying for. Make sure to keep in mind location as well (someone working in a large city will likely make more than a rural area due to the cost of living). Just don’t say the number first. Let them throw out a number first (this is an essential negotiation strategy for just about anything, including salary).\r\n\r\n### Why are you leaving your current job?\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3890\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3890\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Sales Pitch](/posts/4-Sales-Pitch.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3890\">[Joey_Chung](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-323189642/stock-photo-businessman-and-businesswoman-meeting-on-sales-pitch.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWith this question, honesty is the best option, but don’t go negative. You don’t need to go into great detail, but avoid talking down on your current company.\r\n\r\n### Do you have any questions?\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3827\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3827\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 We Don't Know Peace alcoholics](/posts/8-We-Dont-Know-Peace-alcoholics.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3827\">[ESB_Essentials](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-380896702/stock-photo-two-colleages-disagreeing-and-fighting-at-work.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhenever an interview ends you’ll likely be asked if you have any questions. Always, always have at least one question. By having at least one question it shows you have done your research and that you are engaging, both of which are perks. Throughout the course of the interview you’ll probably have a few of your questions answered along the way. Keep one question tucked away though for when you’re asked this (you will be asked this). This question alone is why you need to research your company before going in for the interview.\r\n\r\n### What is your biggest weakness?\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4258\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![listen to people](/posts/shutterstock_172850804.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4258\">[corepics_vof](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-172850804/stock-photo-two-woman-talking-about-the-latest-gossip-on-their-coffeebreak-in-the-office-attentively-listening-to-eachother.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nKnowing your faults can be difficult. Admitting them is even more difficult. If you don’t prepare for this question you may find yourself in trouble. If you prepare, you can ace this question. Focus on something you’ve struggled with in the past but you’re working on. You can talk about past challenges and how you’ve been bettering yourself to improve upon these weaknesses. Companies want to know if you have the ability to identify your own shortcomings. Knowing that you not only can identify them but work on them is a major bonus.\r\n\r\n### What is your greatest strength?\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4250\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![i will help as many people as i can today](/posts/shutterstock_407325712.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4250\">[antonio_guillem](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-407325712/stock-photo-businesspeople-smiling-coworking-commenting-and-showing-growth-graphic-and-taking-a-business.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWho doesn’t like bragging about themselves? Don’t talk about everything, but pick a skill or two that is specific to the job you’re applying for. Whether it is going the extra mile to make sure a project is perfect of focusing on details, stick to what works with your potential new job. Also, provide details as to how you’ve done this in the past. Everything is just hearsay unless you provide an example.\r\n\r\n### Why are you interested in this company?\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3586\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3586\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![banking personal banker account review](/posts/bigstock-Woman-meeting-financial-advise-64564396-e1463938376622.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3586\">[Goodluz](https://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-64564396/stock-photo-woman-meeting-financial-adviser-in-office)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is any question where researching the company is important. Don’t give a generic answer. Those conducting interviews have heard them all and can tell when you’re just saying a general answer or if you’ve actually looked into the business. Look deep into the company. Don’t just do a 10 minute skim on a search engine. Anyone can do that. Putting in the research shows you are serious about the job while also demonstrating your skill at identifying important information most others will not discover. This can go a long way in helping you land the job.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n### Less Money to Spend\r\n\r\n![they are money wise](/posts/shutterstock_224295640.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhile there are other reasons as to why millennials aren’t spending money on cars and homes, one of the biggest reasons is because they have less money to spend. While salaries have increased over time, college costs have skyrocketed, so many young professionals now have tens of thousands of dollars in debt (if not more). Buying a vehicle may simply not fit into the budget.\r\n\r\n### Moving to City Centers\r\n\r\n![Change careers after 40 get rewards](/posts/shutterstock_308851766.jpg)\r\n\r\nRegional migration shifts every few decades. Millennials are now moving away from the suburbs and rural areas to make downtown city centers home. With improved modes of public transportation, owning a car simply isn’t necessary and buying a condo in a major city likely is too expensive.\r\n\r\n### Spending Money Differently\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4225\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4225\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![the rare splurge](/posts/shutterstock_249702325.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4225\">[potowizard](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-249702325/stock-photo-travel-the-world-monument-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMore and more younger adults are prioritizing their money differently. Previous generations focused on buying a home and having children at younger ages. The current young population is waiting longer to do this in favor of traveling and taking in other life experiences (concerts, special events and activities, for example). To prioritize, they spend the money they would on car payments and insurance on these activities.\r\n\r\n### Building Startups\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4245\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4245\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![priority](/posts/shutterstock_427091116.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4245\">[rawpixel.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-427091116/stock-photo-prioritize-emphasize-efficiency-important-task-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are more and more startups now than ever before. With technology readily available to do just about everything at home, millennials are no longer just entering the workforce in a traditional sense but instead starting their own businesses. This costs money to startup so the money used on buying a house or car now goes towards the startup.\r\n\r\n### Fewer Chains\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4093\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4093\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![FHA mortgage](/posts/shutterstock_319421696.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4093\">[michaeljung](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-319421696/stock-photo-portrait-of-happy-couple-sitting-in-new-house.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBusiness is more of a worldwide experience now more than ever before. This means a young professional may move multiple times in their professional career instead of settling down in the first city they land a job. For someone with a 30 year mortgage it is difficult to move across country (or internationally). When there are no homes or cars to worry about, a working professional can move just about anywhere in the world. Opting out of car and home payments reduces the amount of chains holding someone to a given location.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Options\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4038\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4038\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![alternative options Millennials](/posts/shutterstock_223938919.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4038\">  \r\n[oneinchpunch](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/car-sales-one-person-sells-gives-223938919)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are new options for individuals who don’t want to own a vehicle. Between the cost of car payments, maintenance and insurance, an individual will likely pay several hundred dollars a month, and this is just for an inexpensive, used vehicle. Ride share services such as Lyft and Uber make it possible to hail a driver from just about anywhere, often for less than what a taxi costs. This makes it possible to go to the grocery store or another destination easily without having to own a vehicle. These alternative transportation options were not available to previous generations.\r\n\r\n### Changing Jobs\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4407\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4407\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Gajus](/posts/shutterstock_263748254.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4407\">[Gajus](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-businessman-business-suit-showing-small-263748254)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAccording to Forbes, the average young professional changes jobs once every three years or so. This means they need to be able to get up and move quickly. Buying large ticket items makes it difficult to do this, which includes homes and cars. The fewer big ticket items someone relies on the easier it is for them to take on new jobs.\r\n\r\n### Fewer Things, Less Worry\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4303\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4303\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![cut expenses](/posts/shutterstock_77378869.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4303\">[Oliver_Hoffman](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-77378869/stock-photo-hand-with-scissors-cutting-into-label-signed-expenses.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe more items someone owns the more they worry. Millennials are spending less on just about everything, from furniture to big ticket technology items because it often brings about more worry. This especially includes owning a vehicle. Someone who doesn’t own a vehicle will never have to worry about their car being stolen or towed or broken into.\r\n\r\n### Depreciate in Value\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4356\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4356\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![timing is everything](/posts/shutterstock_102373678-e1484005051641.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4356\">[focal_point](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-102373678/stock-photo-balancing-time-and-money.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYounger people have more insights on investments and spending money now than any other generation. Due to this, it is possible to look up how an item depreciates in value as it ages. This is especially true when it comes to a vehicle. For every year and mile someone puts on a vehicle it goes down in value. Many young Americans are looking at this and using it as a reason to avoid buying a vehicle. Why purchase something that will go down in value as soon as it leaves the lot?\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nAmericans are feeling the sticker shock for a prescription drug at their local pharmacy. In the past year, the price of many generics are spiraling upwards drawing the attention of Congress and pinching the wallets of consumers.\r\n\r\n“We are talking about the need of the American people to be able to afford the medicine that their doctors prescribe,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Democratic Presidential candidate and chairman of a Senate health care subcommittee.\r\n\r\n## **What’s the problem?**\r\n\r\n- Many adults take at least one prescription drug\r\n- It’s not uncommon for older people to be on 5 or more medications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n- The way our healthcare system is set up, it can be tough to comparison shop from one pharmacy to another. Even your doctor may not know what you’ll end up paying for a prescription.\r\n- 1 in 5 new prescriptions that are written are never filled. Without insurance, the cost may feel so exorbitant you may be tempted to skip or skimp on medication. Skipping medication can be disastrous and ultimately more costly than the drugs themselves.\r\n- Has the cost of your medication changed? Check out this [database](https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-costs-for-popular-drugs-20141118-htmlstory.html) which tracked 2,400 medications.\r\n\r\n![Drug Help](/Drug-Help.jpg)  \r\n**9 ways to reign in the cost of prescription drugs**\r\n\r\n1. **Purchase from Warehouses** – Costco and Sam’s Club pharmacies are open to non-members where required by State law. Check with your local warehouse. Many prescriptions are substantially cheaper through warehouses, so this can be a real boon to your budget. Surveys indicate you can save anywhere from 25 to 77% on many prescriptions at a warehouse. For example, 30 pills that cost $40 at CVS may run just $10 to $12 at Costco. Check the cost of your prescription at Sam’s Club or Costco. If you are a member of Sam’s Club, you can enjoy additional benefits by joining their Free Rx Program. [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/cp/1078664?povid=5431+%7C+contentZone1+%7C+2014-11-01+%7C+1+%7C+LN-Value+4+Dollar+Prescriptions), [Target](https://www.target.com/pharmacy/generics#?lnk=lnav_%20pharmacy%20services_4&intc=2660563%7Cnull), and other large retailers offers hundreds of prescriptions for $4 for a 30-day supply.\r\n2. **Talk to your doctor about your formulary prescription** – Depending on your insurer’s formulary (a list of medications that are covered), the co-pays for two similar drugs such as Crestor or Zocor to treat cholesterol may be wildly different. To avoid paying for the pricier drug, you need options. When your doctor prescribes a new drug, ask him or her to list the top three choices. Check with your insurer to find out the co-payment on each, and any formulary restrictions that might apply. Then discuss the best options with your doctor.\r\n3. **Generics –** Any quest to save money on medications should start with a conversation with your primary care physician or specialist. Ask your doctor if there’s a generic medication that can be provided instead of a brand name product. The cost of a generic drug is 80% to 85% lower, on average, than brand name products, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. [AARP also offers a drug savings tool](https://healthtools.aarp.org/drug-compare). Just enter in the name of the drug you take, the reason why you’re taking it, and the tool produces a list of similar, less-costly alternatives. Patients can then print the list and discuss their options with their physicians.\r\n4. **Ask your doctor for samples** – Before you fork over the cost of a month’s supply of a drug, you want to know if you can tolerate it. If it’s a brand-name drug, your doctor will likely have samples. Ask for 30 day supply so you can try it before committing. Some doctors may even help assist you on an ongoing basis if the medication cost becomes too prohibitive. It doesn’t hurt to ask.\r\n5. **Pharmaceutical manufacturers’ free trials/coupons** – Manufacturers often will offer a free 30-day trial or a coupon for a discount on the purchase of the drug. Be aware, though, that many of the coupons are for more expensive medications.\r\n6. **Money saving coupons/Prescription savings cards** – If you do not have a prescription drug plan or a prescription medication is not covered by your insurance drug plan, check out these sites for some money saving coupons: [Optimizerx.com](https://optimizerx.com/), [InternetDrugCoupons.com](https://www.internetdrugcoupons.com/), [GoodRx.com](https://www.goodrx.com/?gclid=CjwKEAjw0NytBRD-1d3QsdHNpR0SJACGXqgRoAx7HHKIU45NnzwZ_CLBQ6PKeuHYan8u6gvUDdf1bhoCehHw_wcB), and [Drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/discount-card/)\r\n7. **Drug company patient assistance programs** – Don’t give up hope if you can’t afford the drug your doctor prescribed. Even if you don’t qualify for state or federal discount program, or if coupons aren’t cutting it, you may still be eligible to receive a drug for free or at minimal cost. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have so-called patient-assistance programs to help uninsured and low-income individuals. To search by drug name or pharmaceutical company, check out [RxAssist](https://www.rxassist.org/search), a patient-assistance program.\r\n8. **Consider over the counter alternatives** – In some cases, an over the counter medication may work just as well as a prescription drug at only a fraction of the cost. For example, if the doctor prescribes a drug for allergies, ask him/her if you can instead take Allegra, Claritin, Zyrtec or another medication available on pharmacy shelves. Keep in mind, however, that health insurance plans do not generally cover over the counter medications, so a prescription version might end up being less expensive than one you buy on your own. Compare the costs.\r\n9. **On-Line ordering –** There are many on-line pharmacies that are less costly. If you order prescription drugs online, make sure the site is [VIPPS-certified](https://www.nabp.net/programs/accreditation/vipps/find-a-vipps-online-pharmacy).\r\n\r\n_Happy hunting. Where ever you find the best bargains, medical professionals recommend that you try to order all your drugs from the same pharmacy so they can keep track of potentially risky drug to drug interactions._\r\n"

It also allows you to accomplish more. However, it is all for not if you did not plan it out in advance. It doesn’t you much good to show up early and not have a plan on what to do. You’ll basically just be out valuable sleep. Instead, plan out your morning the day before. You’ll know what to do and what you need to do to accomplish it. If you’re going to wake up early, you need to make it count.\r\n\r\n### Automate Your Schedule\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4414\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4414\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![automate your schedule productive](/posts/shutterstock_555076033.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4414\">[goodluz](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/template-web-mature-businessman-sending-message-555076033)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt’s time to automate your schedule. If you are a busy individual and can’t seem to find time for meetings this is perfect for you. It lets people email you about a meeting and see your available time slots. Whether you are a massage therapist with open blocks or a CEO of a large company, automating your schedule will save you time and help you accomplish more.\r\n\r\n### Take a Break, It’s Good For You\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4415\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4415\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![take a break productive](/posts/shutterstock_577982701.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4415\">[Atstock Productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-businessman-taking-coffee-break-listening-577982701)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSitting in an office all day can box in your creativity. Many people do their best thinking outside of the office. Some people come up with great ideas while in the shower, while others percolate while outside, in the fresh air. Going for a walk doesn’t need to be a break from work. It simply helps get the blood and oxygen flowing in your body, which in turn can help your brain perform better (and come up with that award winning idea).\r\n\r\n### Listen More, Talk Less\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4416\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4416\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![listen productive](/posts/shutterstock_580579297.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4416\">  \r\n[Victor Studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/staff-meeting-discussion-business-room-580579297)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you’re talking all the time you probably aren’t listening as much. You need to listen more and talk less. The more you listen, the more meaningful what you say becomes. You’ll also learn more from others around you.\r\n\r\n### Anti-Resolutions\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4422\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4422\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ant-resolutions productive](/posts/shutterstock_582006334.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4422\">  \r\n[Voyagerix](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/woman-confused-thinking-seeks-solution-paper-582006334)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCome up with activities you need to stop doing. Perhaps it is checking social media during the work day, or visiting Amazon.com in the evening. Maybe you want to stop sleeping with your phone or putting creamer in your coffee. Come up with activities that are wasting your time, are costing you money or making you unhealthy that you can easily stop. When you create a list it is easier to stick to it.\r\n\r\n### Tackle What’s Important\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4418\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4418\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![tackle what's important productive](/posts/shutterstock_573146803.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4418\">  \r\n[Gustavo Frazao](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/take-action-573146803)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEverything you do has varying importance. Some tasks are more important than others and you need to start your work day off with the important ones. If most of your work comes out of your email, you can use a plugin from Google called “[Boomerang](https://www.boomeranggmail.com).” This categorizes the importance of messages so you know what to focus on first.\r\n\r\n### Do What You Love\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4419\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4419\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![do what you love productive](/posts/shutterstock_575090932.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4419\">[garagestock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stop-making-excuses-concept-575090932)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEveryone procrastinates. The problem is when you procrastinate with something meaningless. Have you ever pushed off work for an hour or two, only to realize you basically did nothing in those hours? Did you really need to watch three hours of YouTube videos? It can be difficult to procrastinate, so if you do, make sure it is something you love. Spend time with friends, or go to a concert. Make a memory for yourself. Don’t kill your time with pointless activities.\r\n\r\n### Know How You’ll Respond\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4420\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4420\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Iakov Filimonov](/posts/shutterstock_579097036.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4420\">[Iakov Filimonov](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/diligent-friendly-smiling-manager-making-speech-579097036)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you know how you’re going to respond to something at work it will help you get more done. Usually you’ll know of several possible outcomes from business meetings, interviews and actions taking during the work day. Know what you’ll do and how you’ll respond from each possible outcome. Don’t wait for something to happen and then formulate a plan. That is time wasted.\r\n\r\n### Make a Single Goal For the Day\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4421\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4421\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![make a single goal productive](/posts/shutterstock_580194685.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4421\">[fatir29](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/hand-writing-lets-do-this-woman-580194685)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSome of the most successful people look at a day as a way to be better today than yesterday. How will you be better at the end of the day than you were the day before? Don’t bog yourself down with a long to-do list. This will only frustrate you if the entire list is not completed by the end of the day. Instead, set just one goal for the day. This way, when you finish it, you’ll feel like you accomplished something and you’ll be able to say you are better today than you were yesterday.\r\n\r\n### Enough is Enough\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4417\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4417\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ant-resolution productive](/posts/shutterstock_579460807.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4417\">[R ‘n’ R](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/one-young-adult-man-thinking-bored-579460807)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere use to be an old saying that a captain must go down with the ship. This isn’t the case in the business world though. Sometimes you just need to know when to quit and walk away. There are certain tasks that will simply never work out. You need to know when to quit. The more time you put into a lost cause the more time you take away from other activities. You don’t need to simply quit because your work is getting difficult. Difficult and setbacks are different from a failure. So take a step back, look at if there are ways to improve what you’re doing, and if there isn’t, enough is enough and walk away.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## Ignoring Half of the Couple\r\n\r\nMost of the stories about this involve male advisors ignoring wives while they plan exclusively with the husband. The problem with this is that both partners need to understand and execute the financial plan that hey create with their advisor. Often, wives who are cut out of the process are left not knowing what to do when their spouse becomes unable to manage the money. If your advisor cannot seem to develop a plan that involves both you and your spouse, look for one that does.\r\n\r\n## They Won’t Explain Things to You\r\n\r\n![they won;t explain things to you](/posts/shutterstock_345505142.jpg)\r\n\r\nInvestment can be complicated, but a large part of your advisor’s job is to make sure that you understand how your money is invested. That doesn’t mean that he or she should talk down to you, either. You need to understand where your money is invested, the risks that go along with those investments, the historic return, and the expected return. Whenever a change is made, you should know the reason why your advisor thinks that one your assets needs to be sold and another asset purchased in its place. Similarly, your advisor needs to know what your goals are, and be able to explain how every change in your investment strategy will help you to meet those goals.\r\n\r\n## Being Late\r\n\r\n![being late](/posts/shutterstock_288801062.jpg)\r\n\r\nLook at the behavioral patterns of your adviser. Being late (even once) signals that one party does not value the others time, also signally the potential for oversights in other areas (particularly your finances!)\r\n\r\n## They’re More Worried About Their Returns Then Yours\r\n\r\n![they're more worried about their returns than you](/posts/shutterstock_76996033.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf you’ve decided to use an advisor that works on commission, then you need to be aware that his or her pay is determined by the type of investments that he or she puts you into. Obviously, this is a problem if they can make a lot more money by recommending a product that earns them a large commission but does not make a lot of sense for you. When you’re inexperienced with investing, however, it can be hard to know if your advisor really has your best interest in mind when developing an asset allocation plan. You may want to choose a fee-based advisor who will charge you upfront for advice, but won’t accept commissions for the investment products they recommend. If you do decide to go with a “free” advisor, ask a lot of questions about how much he or she is getting from the investment choices that were made for you. Be suspicious of any commission that is over 2% of the total account value.\r\n\r\n## Not Returning Your Calls\r\n\r\n![not returning your calls](/posts/shutterstock_230614120-1.jpg)\r\n\r\nA common mistake advisors make is assuming that after they have set you up with an initial plan, their job is done. In actuality, you’ll probably have a lot more questions several months after starting your investment plan than you did the day that you got started. If your advisor isn’t returning your calls or emails, then you need to find an advisor who is looking to develop a long-term relationship with his or clients; not just one who wants to make a commission and move on. Of course, be aware that a good advisor will want to do some research before answering complicated questions, so give him or her a few hours or even a day to answer a complicated question.\r\n\r\n## Not Wanting Another Opinion or Custodian\r\n\r\n![not wanting another opinion or custodian](/posts/shutterstock_26394400.jpg)\r\n\r\nSome financial advisors make the mistake of thinking that the fewer people who are involved between you, them, and your money, the better. Unfortunately, such a limited relationship is a breeding ground for fraud and catastrophic mistakes. A third-party custodian, such as an independent brokerage, will send you statements independent of your advisor. That allows you to verify that the account is really earning what your advisor says, and grants you various other protections.Similarly, your advisor should not feel threatened by the opinions of other advisors. If bringing up other ideas is met with a lot f resistance without a good explanation, it may be time to look at other advisors.\r\n\r\n## They Won’t Tell You the Truth\r\n\r\n![they won't tell you the truth](/posts/shutterstock_161909432.jpg)\r\n\r\nA good advisor will have a lot of experience with a multitude of different investments in many different types of markets. Because of this, he or she should feel comfortable telling you why an investment is losing money or why he or she thinks it’s a mistake to buy or sell a particular asset. Getting angry or upset with you after you’ve made the decision, however, isn’t a good sign. A professional advisor knows that sometimes his or her clients will not make the same decision that he or she recommends. They should be able to tell you the truth, but accept your answer.\r\n"

Think about this the next time you spend money on plastic trash bags, craft supply organizers, plastic food storage containers, or storage boxes. Something you would normally throw out could be reused instead. Get in the habit of reusing the containers your already have and not buying empty containers at the store.\r\n\r\n### Make clothes from almost anything\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4381\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4381\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![make clothes](/posts/shutterstock_76482910.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4381\">[Djem](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/hand-sewing-on-machine-76482910)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDuring the Depression, most people made their own clothes, but fabric was extremely expensive. To save money, families would reuse the fabric from flour and feed sacks. Today, hardly anyone makes their own clothes anymore, but many people are in a cycle of throwing away clothes as soon as they are worn out or outgrown. Get in the habit of shopping for used clothing instead of new stuff.\r\n\r\n### Repair your old clothes and shoes\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4382\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4382\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![repair old clothes](/posts/shutterstock_245137288.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4382\">[esolla](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/closeup-woman-hands-sewing-button-245137288)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen items wore out during the Depression, many families would repair the clothing and keep wearing it. Replacing buttons and fixing seems was only the beginning. Families also knew how to refit clothing to fit younger siblings and replace the soles that had worn out in shoes. Incorporate this lesson into your life by looking for ways to repair more than just old clothes. Consider if you could save money by repairing appliances and furniture rather than buying new things.\r\n\r\n### They got conservative in the kitchen\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4383\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4383\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![They got conservative in the kitchen](/posts/shutterstock_282845180.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4383\">[PANYA KUANUN](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/leftovers-shrimp-after-lunch-restaurant-282845180)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFood costs were an enormous part of a family’s budget. That made it imperative to see to it that nothing went to waste. A roast chicken could be turned into a casserole, soup stock, and eventually dog food. A bumper crop of potatoes, apples, or other produce could be made to last for months by being incorporated into hundreds of different recipes. Learn to reuse your leftovers and plan ahead to take advantage of sale items at the local grocery store.\r\n\r\n### Depend on each other\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4384\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4384\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![They depend on each other](/posts/shutterstock_471605174.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4384\">[valleyboi63](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/canada-geese-parents-birds-bring-their-471605174)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCommunities were forced to depend on their members to make it through bad times. Farmers would get together to work on major construction projects such as wells that everyone would benefit from. Women would form sewing circles and watch each other’s children so that everyone could get their work done. No one had to do it on their own.\r\n\r\n### They learned to watch sales\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4385\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4385\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![They learned to watch sales](/posts/shutterstock_155204759.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4385\">[igor kisselev](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/savings-coupons-tilt-get-off-details-155204759)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe Great Depression helped to make sales, coupons, and other retail incentives popular enough that we still have them today. For the first time, consumers were able to plan their purchases based on these sales and create a budget that would allow them to plan purchases weeks in advance. Today, you can still learn to match sales with coupons and plan your shopping trips so that you’re not buying what you don’t need.\r\n\r\n### Canning\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4386\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4386\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![canning](/posts/shutterstock_207408649.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4386\">[monticello](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/jars-pickled-vegetables-garden-marinated-food-207408649)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nGranted, most people knew how to can their produce well before the Great Depression started, but this era of history made people much more aware of the importance of having a supply of food that could last them through tough times. Today, many people continue this by building a supply of shelf-stable foods when they go on sale, and digging into their stash when they need to save money at the grocery store.\r\n\r\n### Enjoy simple pleasures\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4387\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4387\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![enjoy the simple pleasures](/posts/shutterstock_407951059.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4387\">[oneinchpunch](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/group-friends-having-picnic-park-on-407951059)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPicnicking and Sunday drives became popular during this era. While wealthy people could afford vacations, many families during the Depression knew that they could be just as entertained by having a picnic near a lake and/or going for a swim on a nearby beach. Look for simple, fun things that you can do with your family that don’t require a lot of planning or money.\r\n\r\n### Conserve water\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4388\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4388\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![conserve water](/posts/shutterstock_116621380.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4388\">[T.Dallas](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/water-saving-116621380)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe Dustbowl and [several other great droughts](https://oldphotoarchive.com/stories/10-things-people-learned-from-the-Great-Depression) made it necessary for families to think about how much water they were using and take steps to conserve it. Today, similar droughts in some areas of the country have caused water bills to skyrocket. While it may not be time to bring out a metal washtub for the whole family to share, it could be a good idea to learn some techniques for saving water.\r\n\r\n### Never give up\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4389\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4389\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![never give up](/posts/shutterstock_487678633.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4389\">[Dirk Ercken](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/keep-going-moving-dont-quit-stop-487678633)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEven though this period was one the hardest times in the lives of many people, they knew that they had to keep working to get through it. Many people took on extra jobs or worked particularly hard to save money and conserve what they had.\r\n"

Sansa decided to attack Ramsay Bolton, because she was upset and wanted him dead, despite not having enough men. So, she borrowed Littlefinger’s Vale army to defeat Ramsay’s. Worked out pretty well, right? Well, here’s the thing. Littlefinger has a way of getting what he wants, and he’s not just offering up the Vale army for nothing. The fact of the matter is never borrow more than you can repay. Now, who knows what Sansa will be forced to do in order to repay this. Marry Littlefinger and cut Jon Snow out? Have to wait another year before next season to possibly find out, but always keep this in mind.\r\n\r\n## Always Repay Your Debts\r\n\r\nThe Lannister’s really love to remind you “a Lannister always pays his debts.” This is good to keep in mind. Now, not all of the Lannisters are this stand up individuals, but it is a good motto to live by. Pay back your debts, otherwise your debts will swallow you up. This is especially credit card debts. So before you take out more debt, it may be better to pay back your current debts before moving forward.\r\n\r\n## Have a History\r\n\r\n![have a history](/posts/shutterstock_270813506.jpg)\r\n\r\nArya Stark might be one of the most interesting characters in the entire series. She’s also gone through one of the most in depth storylines that is always twisting and turning. When she wanted to become a “girl with no name,” she found it beyond difficult because nobody knew her. Eventually she bailed, became Arya Stark again and is on her way, but you need to make sure people know you. This means building a credit history so credit providers know who you are. This will become important later when you decide to buy a home or a car.\r\n\r\n## Stay On Your Toes\r\n\r\n![stay on your toes](/posts/shutterstock_366405779.jpg)\r\n\r\nYup, back to Arya. When another girl with no name came after her for failure to execute, Arya should have seen her coming as an elderly man, stabbing her with a shank (at least most of the audience saw it coming). In the television show, when someone puts their guard down they tend to not last very long. Arya had been so good about this up until the point of being stabbed, but it shows that if you let your guard down even for an instant and are not at the top of your game, you can be taken advantage of. Protect your financial identity at all cost, as you may end up finding yourself oweing tens of thousands of dollars on credit card purchases you never made.\r\n\r\n## Avoid the Mountain\r\n\r\n![avoid the mountain](/posts/shutterstock_332695790.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe Mountain has been an evil guy since the first season when he took down his own horse after losing a jousting match. Mountains come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. For many people, it is a mountain of debt. You need to avoid being crushed under this mountain. Always make sure you handle your debts. Even the smallest debt, when left unattended, can turn into a mountain and completely destroy you (or come back from the dead into an even bigger issue all together).\r\n\r\n## It Takes Time\r\n\r\n![it takes time](/posts/shutterstock_449823880.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhether you are battling back from bankruptcy or just trying to build your credit score in general, it is necessary to take your time. This isn’t something that happens overnight. The Dragon Queen may be in possibly the position of greatest power now, but this isn’t something that happened instantly. She had to go through all sorts of avenues to reach her current point, including being sold into a marriage. You might find yourself at the lowest point possible with your financial history, but if you stick with it, good things will come.\r\n\r\n## Make it Big\r\n\r\n![make it big](/posts/shutterstock_372930628.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhen making a return, make it big. Jon Snow was as dead as you get, and while most people watching the show assumed he’d be back (it was out of the hands of George R. R. Martin at that point, otherwise he most likely would have stayed dead). If you were hit with bankruptcy, you don’t need to stay down forever. You can come back bigger and better than ever.\r\n\r\nSo don’t be afraid to make a big, grand return. Nobody else needs to see you making the come back and you can do whatever you need to do to make this comeback. In fact, don’t let anyone else get in your way. It is possible to strive for greatness without anyone else knowing what is going on. This way, it becomes even that more of a surprise and a shocker when you burst back onto the scene, as successful as ever. There is nothing wrong with making it big and making your comback grand.\r\n\r\n## Learn From the Past\r\n\r\n![Learn From the Past](/posts/shutterstock_261913334.jpg)\r\n\r\nYes, Bran Stark seemed to age about eight years over the course of what should have been a few months (guess that’s what happens when he isn’t on one full season). However, as the current Three Eyed Raven, he now is able to learn from the past and let it guide him. This is something you need to learn from. You need to look at the past and allow it to guide you.\r\n\r\nIf you see a past mistake you should learn from it. If you have noticed another issue that is preventing you, or may prevent you from being successful financially, do what you can to change it. While the future is locked in stone, it is your stay with what happens to you in the future. Learn from the past.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n### Target Companies\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4351\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4351\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![target companies](/posts/rendered.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4351\">[Alex_po](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-312798089/stock-photo-chart-of-business-decrease-challenge-with-an-arrow-falling-down-concept-of-crisis-with-paper.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIn order to best perform a short sale, you need to target companies that have declining sales and declining earnings. Whenever moving into a short sale, this is the way to go.\r\n\r\n### Large Size\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4352\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4352\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![large size](/posts/shutterstock_340642526.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4352\">[rawpixel.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-340642526/stock-photo-big-business-competition-capitalism-corporate-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile looking for companies and stocks to deal, it is a good idea to look towards stocks that not only are performing poorly, but for stocks from a large company, especially if it has a declining public image. When this happens, it creates a large supply and higher selling pressure. All of this works well with shorting stocks. Additionally, larger companies are more likely to eventually turn around with the stock prices for a variety of reasons (changing CEO, better quarter numbers and so on). This means you will have a better chance to short sell the stocks and reinvest if you want to pick up more for your money.\r\n\r\n### Market Intermediate Term\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4359\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4359\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![market intermediatete term](/posts/shutterstock_105421988.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4359\">[Pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-105421988.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt is best to only short sell stocks when the market’s intermediate term is currently trending down. If it is trending up there is a chance the stocks might increase in value even when there is a slight decline within the specific company.\r\n\r\n### Never Guess\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4354\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4354\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![never guess](/posts/shutterstock_303107618.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4354\">[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-303107618/stock-photo-portrait-blindfolded-elderly-senior-business-man-going-through-social-media-data.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe thing about short selling stocks is you never want to just guess at what might trend down and what is trending up. This will end up you firing off stocks randomly and could potentially lose more money than you gain. Instead, you only want to short sell the stocks that are trending down.\r\n\r\n### Cut Losses Short\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4355\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4355\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![cut losses short](/posts/shutterstock_77882950.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4355\">[fuzzbones](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-77882950/stock-photo-knife-cut-paper-with-losses-word.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen cutting your stocks, it is necessary to cut your losses short whenever possible. If the stocks begin to rally, it is best to try to hold off your losses to around 10 or 15 percent.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Get Greedy\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4131\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4131\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![pay with cash stress](/posts/shutterstock_382446877.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4131\">[ptnphoto](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-382446877/stock-photo-female-hands-counting-us-dollar-bills-or-paying-in-cash-shallow-dof.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is a mistake many people make. They see the money start to roll in and let it ride. The thing about short selling stocks is eventually the stock will turn around on you and the profits could evaporate quickly. Instead, it is better to cash in on the money you make while you can. After you make a good profit over an extended period of time, your best bet is to take your earnings and cash in.\r\n\r\n### Timing is Important\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4356\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4356\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![timing is everything](/posts/shutterstock_102373678-e1484005051641.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4356\">[focal_point](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-102373678/stock-photo-balancing-time-and-money.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe best way to perform a shorting of stocks is to follow specific timing. The best time to sell is after the end of a rally in the market where there will most likely be a lull. There usually is a 50 day moving average, which is the perfect timing period to perform the short sell of the stocks.\r\n\r\n### Bear Markets\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4357\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4357\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![bear market](/posts/shutterstock_262478570-e1484005259789.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4357\">[phushutter](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-262478570/stock-photo-businessman-against-black-bear-on-red-arrow-downward-trend-line-with-sky-cityscape-background-fight-back-bearish-market-concept.html?src=MKCwS-VQM4uiwf2W2VQUtg-1-0)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe best course of action when performing short sells is to generally target in on bear markets. While it might seem a bit obvious, this is a necessary course of action you need to make sure you follow. When you fail to follow through with following a bear market, you are more likely going to pay a steep price on the other side. The thing about a bear market is a true bear market doesn’t come around all that often. Typically one comes around every three to four years and lasts a year and a half. The rest of the time, the market pushes higher. That is why you need to focus on timing, as mentioned in the previous tip. Otherwise, you’ll end up spending far more than necessary (and losing out at the same time).\r\n\r\n### Late Over Early\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4358\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4358\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![late over early](/posts/shutterstock_358363988.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4358\">[kinga](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-358363988/stock-photo-portrait-of-creative-team-working-at-agency-late-night-middle-age-designer-woman-showing-something.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen buying a stock it is always better to be early than late. That way you have time for the stock to take off financially. However, the same is not true in the world of shorting stocks. When you buy early you will cost yourself money. Instead, it is much better to be slightly late when short selling than slightly early.\r\n\r\n### It Moves Quickly\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4360\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4360\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![move it quickly](/posts/shutterstock_85320016.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4360\">[suriyaphoto](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-85320016/stock-photo-business-man-stress-about-falling-of-stock-market.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nStocks generally climb at a steady pace. Outside of a few rapid increases due to specific news from the company, it is a steady pace. However, the same is not true with value declines. Stock declines happen much faster. In fact, a stock decline sinks three times faster than a stock increases in value. That is because bad news tends to travel faster than good news. This also means you have less time to work with on a short sale.\r\n\r\n### Not Unlimited\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4361\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4361\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![not unlimited](/posts/shutterstock_398595901.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4361\">[nicotombo](https://ww.shutterstock.com/pic-398595901/stock-photo--d-illustration-seesaw-balance-between-reward-and-risk-business-concept-isolated-white.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere is a common misconception when it comes to shorting stocks and that is it has both unlimited potential and unlimited risk. Fact of the matter is it is limited on both sides. After all, when buying a stock all you can lose is the value of the stock. So there are limits to keep in mind. This may not affect how you buy and sell the stocks, but it is important insights when weighing whether or not the risk is worth the reward.\r\n\r\n### Not All Stocks Work\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4362\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4362\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![not all stocks work](/posts/shutterstock_361413230.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4362\">[syda_productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-361413230/stock-photo-business-people-having-problem-in-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOne bit of information you need to keep in mind whenever considering shorting stocks is whether or not the stock can even be shorted. Most stock brokers you work with will not allow you to perform a short on a stock with is valued at under $5 (this is because all sorts of fiddling around can occur with penny stocks, so this is typically not an option for you to look into). Additionally, your stock broker may not perform shorting if the stock is not being heavily traded. This is because it is difficult to find shares for you to borrow. It is a good idea to talk with your broker to see what stocks you own you can short.\r\n"

While it can be tempting to skip your work savings plan in favor of paying off the mortgage earlier or going on vacation, it’s important to realize the costs of failing to save for your own retirement. Unlike other expenses, there is no way to take out a loan for this part of your life. Start saving by contributing the minimum required to get your match at work. If this is too much, then start with a smaller amount, then increase your contribution as you get pay raises.\r\n\r\n### Not Having a Budget\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4320\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![not having a budget](/posts/shutterstock_447962296-e1481053520552.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4320\">[denisfilm](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-447962296/stock-photo-woman-sits-near-overfilled-suitcase-lady-holds-green-money-box-money-means-a-lot-tired-of-travelling-alone.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCreating a budget is the only way you can plan and achieve your financial goals. Creating a budget forces you to decide how and where you’re going to spend your money based on living expenses and see where you need to cut back.\r\n\r\n### Not Having an Emergency Fund\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4321\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Not Having an Emergency Fund](/posts/shutterstock_114475027-e1481053640601.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4321\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-114475027/stock-photo-young-woman-getting-stressed-over-finances-in-kitchen.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n<a>Less than 33% </a>of American households are unable to cover a $1,000 emergency. If you’re one of them, then having some cash in reserve should be a top priority. Even if it takes you a few months or years to save the money, now is the time to start saving. An emergency fund not only gives you the ability to deal with small unexpected expenses, but it also is the basis for building wealth. Even saving an extra $5 a month can help you avoid overdraft fees (keep a small amount of money in your savings account that can cover a single bounced check), helping you to keep more of your money. After you a small amount of money, set more goals for yourself such as having enough in reserve to cover the deductible on your insurance or an entire month of bills. While it may take you years to save the six months of emergency funds that most financial advisors tell their clients to have on hand, everything that you save means that you won’t have to rely on loans when an unexpected expense does come up.\r\n\r\n### Paying Over the Top Fees\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4324\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4324\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![paying over the top fees](/posts/shutterstock_336450779-e1481054027967.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4324\">[tom_wang](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-167990879/stock-photo-upset-driver-after-traffic-accident.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTake a look at any fees your bank is charging you for ATM fees, monthly checking account fees, bill pay and more then shop around if you’re not satisfied! There are plenty of comparison sites to let you see what each charges (and offers) side by side and be sure to include credit unions in your consideration.\r\n\r\n### Not Caring About Your Credit Score\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4323\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![not caring about your credit score](/posts/shutterstock_207952477.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4323\">[jane0606](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-207952477/stock-photo-a-road-sign-with-bad-credit-good-credit-words-on-sky-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCertainly everyone knows that there is no way to get a good interest rate on a loan or credit card without a good credit score, but not many people realize that this number is used to determine other things as well. Even if you don’t need a loan in the near future, your credit score is reviewed by employers, insurance agencies, and even law enforcement. For this reason, it’s a good idea to make sure that you’re paying your bills on time and that you have at least one open credit account that is in good standing.\r\n\r\n### Not Having Adequate Insurance Policies\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4322\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4322\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Not Having Adequate Insurance Policies](/posts/shutterstock_167990879.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4322\">[Gustavo_Frazao](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-336450779/stock-photo-wooden-blocks-with-the-text-fees.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile some people do elect to enroll in life insurance, they completely forgo an important alternative, disability insurance (which they are more likely to need.) If your current coverage is inadequate, do research to shop around for supplemental plans.\r\n\r\n### Not Being Strategic About Paying For College\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4325\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![not being strategic about paying for college](/posts/shutterstock_145344370.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4325\">[creativa_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-145344370/stock-photo-anxious-female-graduate-thinking-of-paying-school-fees-with-written-blackboard-in-class.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPlenty of parents want their children to get started in a career without the burden of debt. Unfortunately, too many of them are willing to risk their own financial security to do so. Skipping your retirement savings, taking out a home equity loan, or borrowing money that you cannot afford to pay back will make it a lot harder for you to retire on time. Instead of paying for a school that you can’t afford, look into cheaper options and consider what would be a reasonable amount of debt for your child to pay back after graduation. Many advisors recommend taking out the equivalent of his or her expected first year of salary.\r\n\r\n### Keeping Financial Secrets\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4326\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![keeping financial secrets](/posts/shutterstock_300787658-e1481054285901.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4326\">[Michal_Ludwiczak](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-300787658/stock-photo-hide-a-credit-card-in-his-jacket-pocket-studio-shot.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nHidden debts and bills are one of the worst things that you can keep secret from your partner. If your finances are linked to another person, then you have to be honest about how much income, debt, and assets you actually have. If you have good reasons for keeping these things a secret, then you must take steps to untangle your finances. As long as you share a checking account or a mortgage with another person, you both have to know that the other person is capable of making on-time payments and not overdrawing the account.\r\n\r\n### Thinking an Investment Advisor Is Enough\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4329\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4329\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![thinking an investment advisor is enough](/posts/shutterstock_283523774.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4329\">[helga_esteb](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-283523774/stock-photo-couple-at-home-meeting-with-financial-advisor.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you’re getting advice regarding your investments, that may not include the big picture of your financial health (including if your emergency savings account is even healthy enough for you to investing as much as you think you can.)\r\n\r\n### Becoming House-Poor\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4328\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4328\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![becoming house poor](/posts/shutterstock_264885764-1.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4328\">[mmaxer](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-264885764/stock-photo-3d-illustration-of-stairway-to-house-buy-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nHousing is one of the most common areas that people tend to overspend on. Often, this is done out of the mistaken belief that a primary residence is an investment, not a purchase. The truth is that a high mortgage payment can wreck your ability to save for future emergencies and deal with other issues such as an illness or job loss that can make it hard to meet the obligations of high mortgage payments. Look for a home that can be improved as your finical situation becomes more stable. Keep your mortgage costs low by refinancing if you’ve already purchased a home.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## They Cut Expenses\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of ways you are able to cut your expenses, even without making sacrifices. Consider riding a bike to work or packing your own lunch instead of eating out while on the job.\r\n\r\n## They Set Goals and Follow Through\r\n\r\n![they set goals and follow through](/posts/shutterstock_308851766.jpg)\r\n\r\nPeople who are debt free typically are goal driven. Getting out of debt is one such goal you should strive to obtain. Whether it is just a few hundred dollars or tens of thousands of dollars, getting out of debt is something that takes time, but it is well worth it in the long run. Paying off debt will save you hundreds of dollars every month in your expenses, which is money you can put back into your pocket. These kinds of people set goals and stick with it until the goals are accomplished. It is something you need to focus on and do whatever you can to accomplish. When first starting off following a goal, it is difficult as you’ll need to change your line of thought and what you do in life. However, as you go, it will become that much easier to follow through.\r\n\r\n## They are Willing to be Patient\r\n\r\n![active listening](/posts/shutterstock_300058016.jpg)\r\n\r\nThere is a reason why patience is a virtue. It is not easily obtained and yet it can have such an amazing impact on your life. People who are debt free are often patient. They realize they can’t just go out and buy anything and everything because they have a piece of plastic that says it is alright. They take their time. They save up and they do what is necessary to earn the necessary money in order to purchase items instead of buying something and going into debt over it. These individuals will walk past the new flashy television screens or gaming devices and not feel inclined to drop money on the item. Understanding it isn’t necessary to just go and buy these items right off the bat is important and it is something you need to learn. It might prove challenging initially. After all, if you are use to buying what you see and like, it is not the easiest thing to do. However, the more you do it and the more you begin feeling comfortable walking past these new items, the easier it becomes and the more patients you develop.\r\n\r\n## They Take Responsibility For Their Goals and Actions\r\n\r\n![they take responsibility for their goals and actions](/posts/shutterstock_359437478.jpg)\r\n\r\nBeing responsible is more than just showing to work on time and keeping appointments. To be financially responsible you need to put the needs of the household first. To do this, you need to be out of debt. Swimming in debt can affect you and the rest of your family. It will make it challenging to do just about anything. While giving up a few luxuries may seem a bit challenging at first, you need to do what you can to [pay off the debt](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-characteristics-of-debt-free-people-2014-02-05). A responsible person lives debt free, or is working at reducing their debt.\r\n\r\n## They Do Not Shy Away From Making Sacrifices\r\n\r\n![they don't shy away from making sacrifices](/posts/shutterstock_396376126.jpg)\r\n\r\nOne of the most important characteristics of a debt free individual is they are willing to make sacrifices. This may mean going without cable or cutting down on some of the food you purchase at the store. Maybe ridding yourself of the gym membership and running around the block instead.\r\n\r\n## They are Money Wise\r\n\r\n![they are money wise](/posts/shutterstock_224295640.jpg)\r\n\r\nNow, this doesn’t mean you need to go out and start studying philosophy or anything like that. Instead it is about making wise decisions. Debt free individuals know that debt isn’t a tool. While credit cards can be nice, these people usually don’t think the cards are necessary for their everyday life. They find other ways to pay and to save money. Large payments like mortgages and car payments can eat up income. This is why many people who are debt free instead of buying brand new go for something slightly used, where they pay a fraction of new for a slightly used vehicle. They also pay their money towards debt instead of buying new items. They know ridding themselves of debt faster saves money in the long run.\r\n\r\n## They Are Confident in Their Financial Literacy\r\n\r\n![they are confident in their financial literacy](/posts/shutterstock_127979189.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhen you create a money plan you need to believe in the money plan. It is difficult for many people to not only set a money plan, but to follow it. You’ll need to follow your plan often step by step in order to ensure it works out properly. Confidence in this plan is a must. If you are looking to get out of debt you need to create a money plan and follow through with it. It might take a bit of blind faith at first in order to follow the plan. However, this blind faith can turn into confidence quickly, which will push you through the issues that might pop up along the way. Away from this, you must be confident in driving an older car or not going out and buying the latest fashion. This way you can save money and you can take care of your debt without feeling like you need to go our and purchase anything.\r\n\r\n## They Fight Their Materialistic Urges\r\n\r\n![they fight for their materialistic urges](/posts/shutterstock_320454647.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf you are a materialistic person and you just love “things”, it makes it easier to fall into debt. Whether you need to have the latest pair of shoes a brand new car or go for the oversized house, it is all about material items that bring enjoyment. Now, there are some people who are able to afford this and pay for it without a problem. All of this comes down to knowing your limits and understanding what you can afford and what you can’t. In order to break free of debt though you do need to break free of materialism. Besides, most of the items you purchase you don’t actually need and it doesn’t bring any happiness.\r\n"

You might run out of time, miss out on a meeting because a previous one goes long, which may end up costing you or your company an important account.\r\n\r\n### No Joy\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4268\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![no joy](/posts/shutterstock_426884746.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4268\">[voyagerix](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-426884746/stock-photo-female-contemplating-serious-matters-astonishing-beauty-thinking-about-higher-things.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMost Type A professionals don’t take much joy out of their accomplishments. They might see where they can improve or they just don’t see anything positive. While this can help with driving you, it also takes away from your experience while also taking away from the experience of others within the office.\r\n\r\n### Burn Out\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4269\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4269\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![burn out](/posts/shutterstock_342537272.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4269\">[g-stockstudio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-342537272/stock-photo-feeling-exhausted-frustrated-young-man-carrying-eyeglasses-and-keeping-eyes-closed-while-sitting.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBecause you try to force more into your schedule without taking much joy out of your accomplishments, you may find that you burn out faster. Burn out factor is a major problem when it comes to your career, potentially resulting in you losing your job or losing interest in your current job.\r\n\r\n### Intimidate Others\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4270\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4270\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![intimidate others](/posts/shutterstock_347126168.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4270\">[speedkingz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-347126168/stock-photo-aggressive-businessman-shouting-at-female-colleague.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen you are a Type A you are generally extremely intense. This can intimidate others around you. For some, this is desirable, for others this can cause problems. It really depends who you are around, but a strong Type A is likely going to intimidate others and may cause some problems within the work place.\r\n\r\n### Multitasking Reduces Productivity\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4278\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4278\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![multitasking reduces productivity](/posts/shutterstock_183277928.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4278\">[alphaspirit](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-183277928/stock-photo-concept-of-multitasking-with-businessman-who-carries-out-various-operations.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAs a Type A, you try to get as much done in a short period of time. This generally leads to multitasking. While multitasking seems like a good idea, it can often result in inferior results. If you are trying to do two things at once in the office it eventually leads to reduction in productivity and will reduce the quality of your work all the way around. If at all possible, you need to try and avoid multitasking.\r\n\r\n### Anger Easily\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4271\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![anger easily](/posts/shutterstock_171671267.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4271\">[Maslowski_Marcin](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-171671267/stock-photo-businessman-shouting.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nType A personalities become angry easily. This can be anything from disappointing results to just a perceived waste of time. Whatever the issue, if you lose your temper inside of the office or become so agitated it causes you to shut down and just lose focus on your work, it will end up causing problems not only at the office but you may end up losing your job, depending on how you demonstrate your anger. Become become angry at the office. It just happens. How you handle it and how you show it is what may cause problems.\r\n\r\n### See the Worst in Employees\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4272\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4272\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![see the worst in employees](/posts/shutterstock_268014329.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4272\">[Syda_Productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-268014329/stock-photo-business-technology-and-office-concept-older-man-and-young-man-having-argument-in-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAs a Type A you are more likely to see the worst in someone. This can cause you to look down on someone else and it can also create animosity within the workplace as well. As is the case with many of the traits of being a Type A, you need to just not act or say anything about it, although sometimes there really isn’t anything you can do.\r\n\r\n### Cause Health Concerns\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4273\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![cause health concerns](/posts/shutterstock_313939655.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4273\">[Lisa_S.](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-313939655/stock-photo-a-woman-holding-a-clinical-thermometer-hindquarters-symbolic-photo-for-sick-and-fever.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAs you are more likely easily angered, it will result in higher health concerns. This includes high blood pressure and heart issues. With heart problems and cardiovascular situations, you may end up missing work because of the health concerns. While you can’t change your personality type, you can cope with it, which means finding ways to reduce this stress and the anger levels (such as through exercise).\r\n\r\n### Ask Too Much From Employees\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4274\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4274\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ask too much from employees](/posts/shutterstock_410069455.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4274\">[Piyapong_Wongkam](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-410069455/stock-photo-stacks-of-paper.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen you want to fill so much into the work day, you may end up asking too much from your employees. When this is the case it can cause employee burnout and an elevated stress level within the office.\r\n\r\n### High Work Involvement\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4275\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4275\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![high work involvement](/posts/shutterstock_356083061.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4275\">[d8nn](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-356083061/stock-photo-portrait-of-stressed-business-man-in-the-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou do need to take time for yourself. But Type A individuals tend to over flood themselves with work. It just is your nature. However, you do need to go against your nature and schedule some time away from work where you can just rest up.\r\n\r\n### Bullying Without Knowing\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4276\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4276\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![bullying without knowing](/posts/shutterstock_219738391.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4276\">[photographee.eu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-219738391/stock-photo-troubled-secretary-and-her-angry-director-at-work.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nType A personalities are more likely to become bullies. Although this isn’t the school playground bullying does continue into the work place. You may say or do things you don’t even realize are bullying someone else. Unless someone says something, you may never know until someone quits (or you’re fired).\r\n\r\n### Force Workers Away\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4277\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4277\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![force workers away](/posts/shutterstock_200625674.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4277\">[g-stockstudio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-200625674/stock-photo-tired-of-office-life-rear-view-of-man-in-formalwear-walking-away-from-his-working-place.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you are a strong Type A personality, it may end up forcing workers away. Some people thrive under this kind of pressure and responsibility, while others will wilt and just look for something else. It\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## Treat Groups Like Individuals\r\n\r\nThe problem many people have when speaking to large groups is they treat the group as one entity. Almost like a massive blob, sitting in front of them. The problem here is this blob is made up of individuals, each of whom is listening and spending their own time listening. Now, if there are tens of thousands of people listening, this tactic doesn’t work, but when speaking to a group, it is important to reach everyone as an individual. This means striving to make eye contact with each person and looking at them directly when delivering lines.\r\n\r\n## Your Own Body Language\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4257\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![use your own body language](/posts/shutterstock_93603286.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4257\">[pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-93603286/stock-photo-confident-business-partners-walking-down-in-office-building-and-discussing-work.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTake note of your own body language. You may actually be communicating something you don’t want to be based on what your body is doing. Stay open and never cross your arms.\r\n\r\n## People Listen\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4258\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![people listen](/posts/shutterstock_172850804.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4258\">[corepics_vof](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-172850804/stock-photo-two-woman-talking-about-the-latest-gossip-on-their-coffeebreak-in-the-office-attentively-listening-to-eachother.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou’ve probably been to public speaking sessions where what the person says is just boring. You want to leave as soon as the person started. You want to communicate so people listen and want to listen. How do you do this? You need to read the audience as you talk. This is one reason why you should master the art of eye contact with the group. You can see how each person feels and if they are drifting off by focusing on them. You don’t want to drone on and on about a topic. Cut down to just the meat of what you want to say. Nobody wants fluff, whether reading it or hearing it. However, you also want to engage them with dialog that excites them. Don’t just directly give the main point right off the bat. Build their anticipation, almost like a good story. This way, they want to hear the conclusion and wait around for that final point to wrap up everything.\r\n\r\n## Listen to the People\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4259\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4259\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![listen to people](/posts/shutterstock_289831070.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4259\">[monkey_business_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-289831070/stock-photo-two-female-friends-talking-at-a-coffee-shop.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBeing a great communicator isn’t just about talking to people. Yes, talking is a major part of communication, but you also need to listen. As the head of the group you command attention, but you want to listen so people will talk back. If you just continue to talk and talk over them, they will have no desire to create a two way dialog. Communication is give and take, so you need to open up for the take. One of the biggest problems many people run into is not listening and just talking until they are done. When listening to those you communicate with, you need to look past just what they say. Often times tone and how they deliver the message is important. The volume of their voice can mean something as well. There is context in the way people talk, and you need to learn how to listen to this context to properly communicate with those around you.\r\n\r\n## The Emotional Connection\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4260\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![the emotional conection](/posts/shutterstock_160661273.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4260\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-160661273/stock-photo-two-friendly-male-mature-students-chatting-while-sitting-in-class-room.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThink of some of the all time great movies you’ve seen. Why are these movies great? Sure, their might be action or romance or the movie is funny, depending on your taste for cinema. But the true reason why you love the movie is because you form an emotional connection with the people in the movie. You feel what the character feels. So when they suffer loss, you cry along with them, or you cheer when they accomplish something. It is as if part of what they did or felt you felt to. Why? Because of the emotional connection. The best speakers create an emotional connection between themselves and those listening. Here is the thing about speeches. You may never actually remember exactly what the person said, but you will always remember how you felt about it. Maybe it made you mad, or happy, or sad or any other kind of emotion. You need to make this emotional connection with those you are communicating with. This way, even if they don’t remember everything you say, they will remember how they felt when you delivered it.\r\n\r\n## Read the Signs\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4261\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![read the signs](/posts/shutterstock_152737400-e1476991234271.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4261\">[ESB Professional](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-152737400)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEveryone has specific signs they give off when listening to something. You yourself give off signs without saying a word when listening. Body language is often the very best indicator for what is on a person’s mind. While they might not say it, their body will demonstrate it. So, when delivering your speech or talking with a group, you need to read the body language signs. Maybe people are all standing around with their arms crossed, which means they are less receptive to what you are saying. Perhaps their facial expressions are saying they don’t agree with what you are saying or have something different on their mind. Body language and reading the signs is important.\r\n\r\n## Prepare\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4262\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4262\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![perpare](/posts/shutterstock_361845191.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4262\">[pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-361845191/stock-photo-business-presentation.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPreparation is key. Some people like to just wing it and while there are a few people who are great with this organic, natural approach, it is not for everyone. If you are someone who likes to deliver a speech, or talking points fresh, that is fine, but going through where people might stand, the lighting (so you know where it is located and what to avoid) and sift through your note cards one at a time, it will make it easier with delivering what you want without stumbling.\r\n\r\n## Avoid Tech Talk\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4263\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4263\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![avoid tech talk](/posts/shutterstock_275800298-e1476991398508.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4263\">[monkey_business_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-275800298/stock-photo-businesswoman-presenting-to-colleagues-at-a-meeting.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEvery industry has jargon or tech talk. If you are giving a speech within the community (like talking with IT professionals) you can use this specialized speech. However, for the most part it is best to “dumb it down” so everyone can understand.\r\n\r\n## Active Listening\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4264\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![active listening](/posts/shutterstock_300058016.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4264\">[adam_gregor](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-300058016/stock-photo-two-men-talking.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou need to be an active listener to be a great communicator. To do this, you need to practice. How? Spend more time listening than talking. Also, never answer questions just with more questions.\r\n"

Improvement usually doesn’t come all at once. It is done inch by inch. So if you can improve yourself by even one percent, or a half of a percent today over yesterday, you will know when you go to bed at night you are better off than you had been the night before.\r\n\r\n### I Will Make What is Important a Priority\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4245\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4245\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![priority](/posts/shutterstock_427091116.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4245\">[rawpixel.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-427091116/stock-photo-prioritize-emphasize-efficiency-important-task-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to get lost in everything going on in life that you might focus on the wrong thing. With so many distractions going on, what should you spend your time on? You need to make what is important a priority from the moment you wake up. You know what you need to accomplish or what will be essential to your success. Focus on this and let everything else become secondary.\r\n\r\n### I Will Keep Pushing the Boundaries\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4246\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4246\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![pushing boundaries](/posts/shutterstock_146270402.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4246\">[africa_studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-146270402/stock-photo-business-training-at-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou will never obtain the greatness you seek if you stay within the boundaries. You need to push and prod these boundaries, stretching everything out until you reach your goals. Boundaries are there to protect you and to make you feel safe. However, stepping out of your comfort zone will help you see things with a new perspective. Like a dog pushing boundaries around a fence until finally squeezing through and making it out, you just need to keep pushing, keep searching and keep prodding. Eventually you will make it through to the other side.\r\n\r\n### I Will Stay Positive, No Matter What\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4247\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4247\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![i will stay positive no matter what](/posts/shutterstock_299107895.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4247\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-299107895/stock-photo-young-business-people-in-board-room-meeting-at-the-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWith everything that goes on in this world, it is difficult sometimes to stay positive. Whether it is an event that happens in the work place or on the news, negativity happens and it is something you need to work on. You will also find that if you stay positive, others around you will be more likely to stay positive as well. Positivity can rub off on others, so do whatever you can to stay positive and the results will follow.\r\n\r\n### I Will Cultivate Deeper Connections\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4248\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4248\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![i will cultivate deep connections](/posts/shutterstock_125338145.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4248\">[pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-125338145/stock-photo-image-of-business-partners-discussing-documents-and-ideas-at-meeting.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIn order to succeed in life and in business, you need to have connections with others. These connections need to be more than just skin deep. Deeper connections help forge through more difficult times you may run into. Now, you are not going to instantly create these deeper connections. It is going to take time and something you’ll need to work on every single day. That is why you need to remind yourself to cultivate these deeper connections every day, so that day by day, you can make these connections more important and stronger.\r\n\r\n### I Will Refuse to Take Failure Personally\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4249\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4249\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![i refuse to take failure personally](/posts/shutterstock_151741280.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4249\">[artfamily](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-151741280/stock-photo-small-man-on-the-shoulder-screaming-to-the-ear-of-big-man.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFailure happens to everyone. It is a way of life. Many [people in business](https://leadership.eckerd.edu/resources/insight/9-things-ceos-say-about-themselves/) will tell you that you should expect to fail, go bankrupt or struggle with other issues. What sets you apart though is how you react to it. People who take failure personally allow this problem to linger. The one failure ends up affecting the rest of their life, their future business endeavors and can cause all sorts of other issues. You should never let one failure turn into two. The most successful leaders are those who are able to take from this and learn from failures.\r\n\r\n### I Will Help As Many People As I Can Today\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4250\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![i will help as many people as i can today](/posts/shutterstock_407325712.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4250\">[antonio_guillem](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-407325712/stock-photo-businesspeople-smiling-coworking-commenting-and-showing-growth-graphic-and-taking-a-business.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile you can’t save a burning bus every single day, there are other ways you can help out. Maybe you assist in the work place where you normally wouldn’t or you offer out a favor when someone needs help. All of this can help you with a few different tactics. First, it will make you feel good about yourself. Knowing you helped someone, even in a small way, can be emotionally lifting. Second, it helps other people respect you and appreciate what you do. Third, it helps build your influence. People remember what you do for them and often will return with a likewise favor. Now, this isn’t always the case. There will be those who receive help and never ever repay you or help you. You shouldn’t do something expecting a favor in return, but you can help others to boost your influence.\r\n\r\n### I Will Appreciate People\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4251\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4251\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![i will appreciate people](/posts/shutterstock_379643950.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4251\">[imtmphoto](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-379643950/stock-photo-caucasian-business-executive-praising-subordinate-by-giving-a-pat-on-the-shoulder.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are all sorts of people out there who help you become who you are. If you have worked your way up the ladder, you know how difficult it is to be an assistant, an intern or the mail room guy. All of this is lower level work that receives very little in way of attention. You need to make sure they feel appreciated. Show your thanks and gratitude. Whether it is the person bringing you coffee, the guy selling bagels around the corner or someone else in the office, people want to feel appreciated, and by showing your appreciation it truly goes a long way.\r\n\r\n### I Will Live in Gratitude\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4252\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![i will live in gratitude](/posts/shutterstock_269605811.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4252\">[gustavo_frazao](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-269605811/stock-photo-business-man-pointing-the-text-gratitude.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen you reach the top you will have an appreciation for the work it took you to get there.

Conversely, why would a middle-class family man risk his comfortable, blue-collar job to enroll in law school? If you are considering a career change, you may know the answer. Often, we do not take the time to assess ourselves when embarking on a career. Whether we follow in our parents’ footsteps or gravitate to what we think will make us the most money, many of us find ourselves in careers not suited to our personality. This leads to unhappiness.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason for your discontentment, it is important to not jump into anything new until you take the time to get to know yourself. What are you good at? What type of work environment fits best with your personality. It may benefit you to take a [career personality quiz](https://www.careershifters.org/expert-advice/how-to-match-your-personality-to-your-career/) to help you answer these questions.\r\n\r\nSarah Martin, owner of Star Thrower Virtual Services, used the Myers &amp; Briggs personality test when she was feeling unfulfilled with her job as an engineer. She used her test results to develop a company that gave her the creative outlet she needed to reach her full career potential.\r\n\r\n### Lean on your support system\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4176\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4176\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![lean on your support system](/posts/shutterstock_437022181.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4176\">[dean_drobot](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-437022181/stock-photo-multiethnic-group-of-smiling-young-business-people-standing-and-talking-in-conference-room.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYour decision to make a change will probably have an impact on others besides you. If you have a family to support, it is important to involve your spouse or other stakeholders in your decision process. Even if you are single, you need to think about how your decision might affect you down the road.\r\n\r\nIt boils down to being honest with the people in your life about what led you to the decision to switch careers, and giving them a say in your decision. Include your loved ones in your decision-making process so they have a better idea of your motivation. Finally, allow your loved ones to support you when you feel discouraged. They are a good resource when you need a reminder of the reasons you embarked on a career change in the first place.\r\n\r\n### Check your budget\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4177\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4177\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![check your budget](/posts/shutterstock_290693624.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4177\">[Stokkete](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-290693624/stock-photo-business-professionals-working-together-at-office-desk-hands-close-up-pointing-out-financial-data-on-a-report-teamwork-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDo you have the funds to take some time off? How’s your credit? If you need to go into debt, you want to make sure your credit score is as high as possible to get the best rates. Knowing your financial situation in advance will ease the stress of making the change.\r\n\r\n### Don’t be afraid to go back to the drawing board\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4178\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4178\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![go back to drawing board](/posts/shutterstock_246951712.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4178\">[sunkids](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-246951712/stock-photo-woman-creating-gift-at-home-with-paper-and-gouache.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAfter you categorize your strengths and weaknesses, consider your financial goals, and obtain an idea of what your ideal career would entail, you may realize that you need to start from scratch. For some, this may mean renewing an old hobby or dusting off your old liberal arts degree. For others, it may mean an entirely new educational path, pursuing higher education, or even learning a new trade.\r\n\r\nFor some, a career change may still take place within one’s realm of expertise, but often new skills and knowledge will be required to make the change successful.\r\n\r\n### Be ready to face challenges\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4179\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4179\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![be ready to face challenges](/posts/shutterstock_271483541.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4179\">[Rostislav_Sedlacek](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-271483541/stock-photo-young-tired-businessman-rubbing-his-eye.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nA successful career change won’t happen overnight. You will have doubters, you will probably doubt yourself at times, and you will probably periodically question your choice. Make a list ahead of time of the obstacles you anticipate and develop a strategy of how to deal with them so you don’t let them stop your process.\r\n\r\n### Volunteer your time\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4180\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4180\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![volunteer your time](/posts/shutterstock_437022181-1.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4180\">[xseon](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-245456581/stock-photo-a-volunteer-taking-care-of-a-two-months-old-one-eyed-sick-kitten-in-a-cat-refugee.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are in a situation where you know you aren’t happy but you’re not sure where to go or what to do. One of the best ways to figure out the right path is to volunteer. Volunteering your time in a variety of settings will help you understand where your priorities are, what you’re good at, and what you want to achieve.\r\n\r\nVolunteering will help you learn about yourself and translate learned skills to future positions. And of course, volunteering makes us feel good (and looks great on a resume).\r\n\r\n### Set goals and keep to a schedule\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4184\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4184\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![set goals](/posts/shutterstock_364784693.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4184\">[nicoelnino](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-364784693/stock-photo-coach-teaching-about-the-way-of-setting-goals-concept-about-objectives-and-success.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou may decide to change careers on a whim, quitting your job by storming out of your office cubicle. Hopefully, your decision is a little more planned out, but even if it isn’t, take the time between careers to set goals. Make a list of what you want to accomplish, using the results of your self-analysis (see tip number 1, above), where you see yourself in 5 and 10 years, and your budget, and strive to stick to a timeline to help you achieve your goals.\r\n\r\nThe most successful people, from Bill Gates to Elon Musk, try their best to know where they are going and how to get there.\r\n\r\n### Make connections\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4182\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4182\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![make connections](/posts/shutterstock_243503950.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4182\">[rawrpixel.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-243503950/stock-photo-group-of-business-people-meeting.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get in with that company you’ve always wanted to work for or hear about new opportunities is to know the right people. Sometimes, knowing the right person is as easy as reaching out to a relative in the industry you want to break into. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t know anyone, though. It is likely that there are networking events in your area. You can also join your local Chamber of Commerce. And, it never hurts to take a leap and make a face-to-face introduction to an HR representative.\r\n\r\n### Ramp up your resume\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4076\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4076\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![resume](/posts/shutterstock_217401814.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4076\">[andrey_popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-217401814/stock-photo-cropped-image-of-businessman-analyzing-resume-at-desk-in-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nUnless you’re striking out as an entrepreneur, you want to refresh your resume. Make sure you include any continuing education you’ve completed, boards you serve on, and volunteer activities if your resume doesn’t apply to what you want to do.\r\n\r\n### Commit to the change\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4183\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4183\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![commit to the change](/posts/shutterstock_286605134.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4183\">[bikeriderlondon](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-286605134/stock-photo-young-businesswoman-on-call-with-colleagues-in-background-at-office-corridor.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou can’t start over if you have only one foot out the door. Once you’ve done your homework, sharpened your skills, and set your goals, you need to cut ties with your old career. It may be tempting to try and transition slowly, especially if you’ve had a long career in one industry, but often it’s best to rip off the Band Aid and start fresh.\r\n"

New paint and siding can greatly improve the curb appeal of your home, making it much more likely that buyers will be interested in looking at the place. Enhancing your curb appeal can also give the impression that the house is well-maintained. New siding can be a significant investment, but buyers appreciate knowing that it’s an expense they won’t have to deal with for a while. If you can’t afford to install new siding or paint, consider making an investment of time into improving your landscaping. Mowing the grass and trimming back shrubs costs virtually nothing, and it can improve the appearance of your home by a lot.\r\n\r\n### Garage Door\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4186\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4186\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![garage door](/posts/shutterstock_243086734.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4186\">[rontech3000](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-243086734/stock-photo-garage-door.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile this may seem like a relatively minor thing, garage doors can pay back at least 87% of their installation cost when it comes time to sell your home. That’s why investing in a higher-end door can be a good choice if you have to replace your door anyway. In particular, buyers are interested in doors that have windows and those that come with extra insulation. Carriage-style doors are also very popular. Be sure to point out the lower energy costs when it’s time to sell the house.\r\n\r\n### New Flooring\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4188\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4188\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![new flooring](/posts/shutterstock_80066764.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4188\">[michael_pettigrew](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-80066764/stock-photo-top-view-of-a-man-installing-planks-of-hardwood-floor.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWith so much focus on allergens, many people are opting for homes with no carpet. That makes it worth the investment in new wood, vinyl plank, or tile flooring. In fact, it’s estimated that new flooring returns an average of 91% of its installation cost. If you’re thinking of replacing your flooring, spend a lot of time researching your options. It’s possible for flooring to look very similar, but have wildly different price options. If you’re thinking about selling in the near future, talk to a realtor about what type of flooring will enhance the value of your home the most. Very expensive flooring in a moderately-priced home will do very little to increase its value, while cheap flooring in a more expensive home can actually lower the expected selling price.\r\n\r\n### Insulation\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4189\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4189\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![insulation](/posts/shutterstock_203363170.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4189\">[speedkingz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-203363170/stock-photo-builder-installing-insulating-board-into-roof-of-house.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOn the surface, it may seem that insulation doesn’t add a lot of value to a home. After all, buyers seem to be much more interested in the kitchen or bedrooms than what type of foam is in the attic. Good insulation, however, can dramatically lower the energy cost of a home, which is a big selling point in many markets. It also protects the plumbing and wiring in a home, extending the life of these items. Buyers also appreciate the fact that this major construction work is already done, giving them one less thing to worry about. Because of this, higher quality insulation will recoup\r\n\r\n### Painting, Refinishing, and Cleaning\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4190\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4190\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![painting refinishing and cleaning](/posts/shutterstock_228904324.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4190\">[syda_productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-228904324/stock-photo-business-building-teamwork-and-people-concept-group-of-builders-in-hardhats-with-plastering.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAll three of these improvements are relatively low-cost, yet they return their cost or more when it comes time to sell. Peeling paint and dirt can be serious turn-offs to potential buyers who see these items as taking a lot of effort to fix. With paint, stick to high quality finishes in neutral colors. Buyers need to be able to see their furniture and belongings in your rooms, and a “statement” color can seriously detract from that. Take your time and do it right; uneven lines and brush strokes are just another thing that buyers will have to fix. Cleaning your home is similar, make sure the place looks ready to show. Consider hiring professional cleaners before you start to show the home; it will be a lot easier to maintain the work they do than do it yourself.\r\n\r\n### Roof\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4192\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4192\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![roof](/posts/shutterstock_212157436.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4192\">[paul_tessier](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-212157436/stock-photo-new-roof-shingle-being-applied.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis can be an expensive item to replace, but a new roof is estimated to return about 105% of what was spent on it. Because roofs have to be replaced on schedule, the age of a roof is one of the first items that home buyers ask about. Since every roof is rated by how many years it will last, it’s possible to know exactly when an older roof will need to be replaced, and to calculate the value left in a newer roof. Newer roofs also help to lower insurance costs for potential buyers. This means that many buyers are willing to pay more for a home with a newer roof. At a particular premium are metal roofs that dramatically lower insurance costs and last for decades.\r\n\r\n### Adding an In-Law Suite\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4193\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4193\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![add in-law suite](/posts/shutterstock_115881952.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4193\">[photographee.eu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-115881952/stock-photo-modern-bedroom-in-the-attic-of-contemporary-house.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThese areas usually include a bathroom, small sitting area, and a kitchenette. With so many older Americans wanting to age at home, these suites are becoming very popular among potential buyers.\r\n\r\n### Small Bathroom Remodel\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4194\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![small bathroom remodel](/posts/shutterstock_306355703.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4194\">[breadmaker](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-306355703/stock-photo-large-furnished-bathroom-in-luxury-home-with-tile-floor-fancy-cabinets-large-mirror-shower-and.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBathroom remodels that cost less than $5000 tend to return at least that much when it comes time to sell.This price range usually allows homeowners to update sinks and tubs, but typically doesn’t allow\r\n\r\n### Additional Bedrooms\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4195\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![small bedroom](/posts/shutterstock_151209257.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4195\">[Santiago Cornejo](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-151209257/stock-photo-interior-design-big-modern-bedroom.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBuilding an additional bedroom costs between $10,000 and $15,000, and it can return that much or more when it’s time to sell.

Most cost less than $10,000 to install, and they’re a selling feature for home buyers who are looking for additional space to entertain. Focus on creating a space with a lot of natural light.\r\n"

There are plenty of parks which you can visit, ranging from your local parks to state and national parks. Start local and go exploring for an afternoon. Remember to bring sunscreen and insect repellant. If you decide to explore the state or national parks, there are times when you can [go for free](https://lifehacker.com/all-the-days-in-2016-you-can-get-into-national-parks-fo-1752826960). Visit their websites beforehand to learn what to bring, what hazards you need to avoid and where to go inside the parks so that you can get the most out of your experience.\r\n\r\n### Find the Best Time to Book Your Transportation\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4157\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4157\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![find best time to book](/posts/shutterstock_337016648.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4157\">[stock_rocket](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-337016648/stock-photo-online-payment.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhether you take the train or fly, a significant amount of your vacation budget will involve transportation. You’ll want to book your tickets between six and eight weeks in advance. Keep an eye out for the best deal by using sites such as Kayak, a popular travel search engine that will help you find and reserve flights or hotels that fit your budget. You should also check with the airlines and see if they offer any discounts.\r\n\r\n### Hit the Road\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4158\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4158\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![hit the road](/posts/shutterstock_394099399.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4158\">[jacob_lund](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-394099399/stock-photo-happy-young-couple-with-a-map-in-the-car-smiling-man-and-woman-using-map-on-roadtrip.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you hate to fly or get claustrophobic on trains, a road trip might be a better solution. You will still have to pay for gas, food and lodging, but you can split the costs with friends or family. Road trips offer something that flying and train rides do not–the ability to choose your own route to your ultimate destination. You can stop to eat or take a picture whenever you feel like it. Use apps such as FuelMyRoute and RoadTrippers to discover places you have never been or even known about.\r\n\r\n### Choose a Bed and Breakfast or Airbnb over a Hotel\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4159\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4159\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Choose a Bed and Breakfast or Airbnb over a Hotel](/posts/shutterstock_407858398.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4159\">[Goran_Bogicevic](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-407858398/stock-photo-young-couple-having-a-breakfast-in-the-bed.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nHotels are fine if you want to be pampered, but they can be pricey. Cheaper and more charming alternatives include Bed and Breakfast hotels or Airbnb, where you will find listings of vacation homes for rent. Depending on your destination, you may find several B&amp;Bs and Airbnb’s in the area. The accommodations may be smaller, and you will have to do your own cooking. If you enjoy a more charming locale with personality, which may be closer to your destination, then they will be worth it.\r\n\r\n### Last Minute Travel Perks\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4160\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4160\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![last minuter travel perks](/posts/shutterstock_384282592.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4160\">[pim_pic](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-384282592/stock-photo-last-minute-to-count-down-for-travel-metaphor-by-old-retro-clock-on-sand-beach-abstract-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you like to do things at the last minute, you can take advantage of of the discounts that airlines, trains and hotels offer in order to fill empty spaces. Since airlines don’t release all the frequent flyer seats right away, you are probably better off waiting until the last minute.\r\n\r\n### Book a Travel Package\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4161\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4161\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![book a travel package](/posts/shutterstock_153811475.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4161\">[docstockmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-153811475/stock-photo-all-inclusive.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you want to take a cruise, a group tour or a sightseeing trip, a travel package may be your best option. Travel packages offer group discounts on airfare and hotels. You can take the DIY route and use a travel aggregation site, such as Hipmunk. You can also use Flightfox, which uses experts to track down cheap flights. Your best option, although more expensive, is a travel agent. Not only can the agent find a good deal on airfare and hotels, but she might be able to book tickets to major tourist attractions at a discounted rate.\r\n\r\n### Take a Cheap Cruise\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4162\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4162\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![take a cheap cruise](/posts/shutterstock_281050655.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4162\">[muratart](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-281050655/stock-photo--beautiful-white-giant-luxury-cruise-ship-on-stay-at-alanya-harbor.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCruises can be expensive, but there are ways to get in on the cheap. Wait until the last minute and see if there are any rooms available. If there are, they will most likely have a discounted fare to fill the ship. Take a cruise on a smaller boat, because they offer fewer attractions and amenities. Consider taking a cruise in the off season. The best part about that is that you may not have to deal with crowds on and off the boat.\r\n\r\nAlso consider taking a repositioning cruise. These occur when a cruise line moves a ship from one part of the world to another in anticipation of the upcoming season. While you’ll find many DIY options, you’ll want to use an agent because he can find much lower prices that you might find. He can also act as a liaison to the cruise companies if something goes wrong.\r\n\r\n### Hit the Trails\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4163\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4163\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![hit the trails](/posts/shutterstock_181239326.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4163\">[monkey_business_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-181239326)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCamping is a wonderful alternative to traditional vacations, allowing families to get exercise, enjoy the outdoors and do it all a lot cheaper! Some families even do a backyard camp, allowing their children to pick out the campsite with everyone working together to pitch the tent but still having a restroom when the need arises!\r\n\r\n### Organize a Group Trip\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4164\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4164\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![organize a group trip](/posts/shutterstock_275504699.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4164\">[monkey_business_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-275504699/stock-photo-group-of-friends-on-walk-balancing-on-tree-trunk-in-forest.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou can save a lot of money by traveling in a group. Hotels and airlines will give discounts for bulk purchases. Some major tourist attractions may also offer bulk discount rates. You can go on these attractions together, or you can decide not to go and each do your own thing. Group trips can be very flexible.\r\n\r\n### Enjoy a Staycation\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4165\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4165\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![stayvacation](/posts/shutterstock_113965345.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4165\">[monkey_business_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-113965345/stock-photo-family-lying-upside-down-on-sofa-with-daughter.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nStaycations don’t mean just sticking around the house and lounging in front of the TV, although that might sound like the ultimate vacation. You can book a nearby hotel to have a romantic getaway. You can also visit some of the sights that you have always been meaning to see but never had the time. This would be the perfect opportunity to visit these places. Daytrips can include hiking excursions, a visit to a museum or art gallery, going to a restaurant that is normally out of your budget and more. The biggest challenge with a staycation is making sure you stay disconnected from your smartphones and emails. If you have to use them, use them to send pictures of your outings to your friends and family.\r\n\r\n### Focus on Cheap Cuisine\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4166\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4166\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![cheap cruise](/posts/shutterstock_71230279.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4166\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-71230279)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nA lot of new hotels are cropping up that have en suite kitchens _and_ complimentary stocked pantries! These allow guests to cook a lot of their food, opting for healthier meals rather than eating out and a massive cost savings!\r\n\r\n### Take Advantage of the Off-Season\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4167\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![off season](/posts/shutterstock_47218873.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4167\">[marcel_a.\\_mayer](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-47218873/stock-photo-winter-beach.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTraveling in the off-season has its advantages. For one, it is a great way to visit popular destinations that would be too expensive to go during peak seasons. You won’t have to deal with the summer crowd, which means that you will have greater access to the attractions you want to see at a reduced price. The only downside is the weather.\r\n\r\nThe best time to plan a trip like this is during what is called a shoulder season. Shoulder seasons occur between the peak and off seasons. You will still get to see the places that you want to see at discounted rates and fewer people, but the weather will be more temperate.\r\n\r\n### Try a 1 Tank Road Trip\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4168\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4168\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![1 tank road trip](/posts/shutterstock_269260949.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4168\">[Soloviova Liudmyla](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-269260949)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nGet out your trusty map and plan a miniature road trip on only one tank of gas! You’ll still be getting out of the house and seeing new sights, while not overextending yourself (or your budget!)\r\n"

It is far easier to keep track of everything if you have a single savings account and a single checking account all in one. If you have multiple accounts, consider consolidating it into a single branch with the best services. This makes it easier on yourself and you will be less likely for any banking errors or lost information to cost you. The same should be done with your retirement accounts as well. Roll everything into one self-directed IRA account, especially if you have older accounts from former jobs.\r\n\r\n### Cut the Credit Card Numbers\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4122\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![cut the credit card stress](/posts/shutterstock_71576065.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4122\">[nenetus](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-71576065/stock-photo-cutting-up-credit-card-with-scissors.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDo you have a half dozen credit cards? It is time to streamline this. First, you should look at paying individual cards down and then cut it up and dispose of it. Now, you shouldn’t close the account completely because that is still a line of historical credit that can prove beneficial to you. But how many credit cards do you really need? If you have an AMEX than you do need a second Visa or MasterCard to cover where AMEX isn’t accepted. Outside of this, you only really need another card if you have a small business account.\r\n\r\n### Ditch the Paperwork\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4123\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4123\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ditch the paperwork](/posts/shutterstock_338000447.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4123\">[rawpixel.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-338000447/stock-photo-man-checking-emails-coffee-break-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPaperwork is no good. Nobody wants to deal with it, yet you probably receive all sorts of documentation in the mail. All of this is enough to cause a rather large headache dealing with it all. Documents and statements from investments, banks, loans and anywhere else piles up. Ditch the paperwork if possible so you receive emails instead. If it helps, have a dedicated email address just for your financial information.\r\n\r\n### Ditch Unnecessary Services\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4124\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4124\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ditch unnecessary services](/posts/shutterstock_108415442.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4124\">[phovoir](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-108415442/stock-photo-two-businessmen-discussing.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou probably have subscriptions and services you really don’t need. This is money coming out of your pocket, and for what? Maybe you have that audio book monthly download you hardly ever use. Cancel that (you can always return). Cancel other services you don’t use or downgrade what you may want from time to time. This is money you can put back into your account or to help pay off debt.\r\n\r\n### Reduce Goals\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4125\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4125\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![reduce goals stress](/posts/shutterstock_225502903.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4125\">[bikeriderlondon](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-225502903/stock-photo-rear-view-of-man-relaxing-on-chair-at-home.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEveryone needs goals, so you should still have some. However, if you have a ton of goals it will make it difficult to focus on one. If you spread out all your time over a dozen goals, you’ll never complete any of them. Instead, focus your time on one, go after it, and then move on to the next goal. You’ll find you accomplish more and feel more fulfilled. This doesn’t mean you are abandoning different goals, it just means you are prioritizing some over others.\r\n\r\n### Investment Funds\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4126\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4126\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![investment funds stress](/posts/shutterstock_263120237.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4126\">[tzido_sun](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-263120237/stock-photo-mix-coins-and-seed-in-clear-bottle-on-white-background-business-investment-growth-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nInvesting in stocks is stressful. Real stressful. Watching the market going up and down can cause all sorts of problems and issues with your health. You may even become compelled to check the stocks far too often. Instead, consider pumping your investments into funds instead. Mutual funds are safer and consistently remain strong. Exchange traded funds work in a similar manor. Either way, it reduces your level of stress drastically.\r\n\r\n### Rent Your Home\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4127\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![rent your home stress](/posts/shutterstock_295804082.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4127\">[andy_dean_photography](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-295804082/stock-photo-red-for-rent-real-estate-sign-in-front-of-beautiful-house.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nNow, there are many people who will tell you it is better to buy than to rent. After all, you are putting money into an investment you can potentially sell for growth later on. However, owning a home comes with all sorts of long term expenses and responsibilities. You may not know where you want to be in a few years, and by renting you won’t be saddled with maintenance, HOA or unexpected expenses that come up. It is easier to budget your renting expenses than owning expenses. This, by nature, simplifies your financial life.\r\n\r\n### Focus On What Brings in the Income\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4129\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4129\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![focus on what brings in the income](/posts/shutterstock_372393523-1.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4129\">[monkey_business_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-372393523/stock-photo-portrait-of-male-owner-standing-in-gift-store.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is more geared towards the [small business owner and self employed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nancyanderson/2014/01/10/5-fearless-ways-to-simplify-your-finances-in-2014/#2b5d98dd2354). What makes you the most money? Yes, you probably have a few pet projects, but chances are you are not making much money on those. Focus most of your time on what is bringing in the income. You can use the additional income to pay off those debts and then to focus on achieving the goals.\r\n\r\n### Go Easy on the TV and Internet\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4130\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4130\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![go easy on tv and internet stress](/posts/shutterstock_255385252.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4130\">[pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-255385252/stock-photo-charming-girl-sitting-by-wooden-table-and-reading-book.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFocusing on what everyone else says is distracting. You need to follow your own goals and set your own timetable. If you are constantly listening to what the experts say, you’ll drive yourself crazy. After all, what these so called experts say changes every few months. This becomes more confusing than anything else. So, instead of dealing with this kind of an issue, you’ll be far better off just going with less TV and less Internet so you don’t have to hear the continual speak of these “experts.”\r\n\r\n### Pay With Cash\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4131\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4131\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![pay with cash stress](/posts/shutterstock_382446877.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4131\">[ptnphoto](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-382446877/stock-photo-female-hands-counting-us-dollar-bills-or-paying-in-cash-shallow-dof.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWho carries cash any longer? You should. Paying with cash reduces all of the paperwork of credit cards and it prevents you from building up debt. Now, if you are debt free and building up those vacation points on the credit card, go right ahead, just know you are more likely to spend more on a credit card than cash, because with cash you know how much you have to spend.\r\n\r\n### Go Debt Free\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4132\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4132\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![go debt free stress](/posts/shutterstock_207907747.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4132\">[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-207907747/stock-photo-closeup-portrait-happy-excited-young-business-man-executive-looking-monthly-statement-glad-to-pay.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYup, it is the dream for many people, but it is something you should shoot for. Holding debt costs you money every single month. It might actually cost you hundreds of dollars, if not more, every month, based on the interest you’re paying. Think of what you could do with all of that extra money. By removing debt, you remove complications. So target one form of debt and do everything you can to eliminate it.\r\n\r\n### Budget Everything\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4133\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4133\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![budget everything stress](/posts/shutterstock_243661255.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4133\">[dragon_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-243661255/stock-photo-woman-distributing-family-budget.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBudget everything and you’ll always know where you stand.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## Research\r\n\r\n![wedding research](/posts/shutterstock_360426944.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt all starts with research. Don’t just go to the first photographer you see listed in your area. Just like hiring a plumber or an electrician, you want to know about your photographer, what they cost, what services they provide and anything else associated with it. You can also go over their portfolio to see if it is a style you love. Always make sure to look into the actual services though, as one might through in engagement photographs for free, while someone else might not provide this service and offer only a few hours with of photography on your wedding day.\r\n\r\n## Look Towards the Off-Season\r\n\r\n![wedding look to the off season](/posts/shutterstock_248763127.jpg)\r\n\r\nNow, you shouldn’t change your wedding planning just for the photographer. However, if you are looking for ways to have an amazing wedding and save money all around, look towards having a wedding offseason. Just about everything you book will be cheaper, including a photographer. You can also look at having your wedding on a Friday or a Sunday. Saturday weddings are the most common and also the most expensive. If you go for a Friday or Sunday your photographer will be able to work two weddings over the weekend and will likely drop down your price, even though you receive the same services as the person who has their wedding during the week.\r\n\r\n## Price Range\r\n\r\n![price range wedding](/posts/shutterstock_418403209.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou have a price range that you can afford. Don’t go over it. Sure, someone might take the most incredible photographs in the world, but if you can’t afford it, you should avoid it. While asking someone to reduce their price may seem like an option, it generally isn’t all that tactful (especially if it is substantially less). When you see those beautiful photographs, it takes far more work in the editing room working on every picture than what others put in, which is why the price point increases. You also pay more for experience and these individuals likely are booked up in advance. Asking them to go less when they are already a popular photographer will result in a no as they can find someone else to book the same weekend for their going rate.\r\n\r\n## Ask for Referrals\r\n\r\n![wedding ask for referrals](/posts/shutterstock_223908613.jpg)\r\n\r\nNow, if you love the photographer but you know they are out of your price range, you can ask them if they know anyone else who is good for your price point. Many photographers will be more than willing to point you in the direction of quality photographers for a price more in your liking. When you find those who are in your price point, you need to make sure they are able to provide the style or look you’re going for. You should always meet up with the photographer you are interested in so you can talk over your vision face to face. It is far easier to do this than to shoot each other emails back and forth.\r\n\r\n## Skip the Other Events\r\n\r\n![skip the other events wedding](/posts/shutterstock_150361421.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou will have all sorts of events leading up to your wedding. This can include showers, parties, rehearsal dinners and so on. You don’t need to have your photographer for all of these. In fact, this is just a large amount of money you’ll pay you don’t need to. The wedding is the main event and you should save your money for the main event. There are plenty of family members who can snap pictures of you opening gifts or performing other activities. Your wedding is going to be what you look at pictures of further on down the road, and while having some beautiful photographs from the other events is nice, if you want to trim off money from the wedding costs, look towards only using the photographer at the wedding.\r\n\r\n## Up and Comers\r\n\r\n![up and comers wedding](/posts/shutterstock_198752252.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe established photographer will charge more. They have a larger client base and they are able to charge more because more people want them. Newer photographers don’t have this kind of client base and so they need to charge less while they build their name and their portfolio. There is nothing wrong with going with an up and comer photographer. Now, they will not have as much experience with events or situations at weddings. If you ask a photographer they will tell you all sorts of crazy stories and what they had to do to deal with the situation. While the new photographer won’t have that kind of experience, they can make up for it with enthusiasm. Of course, you don’t want to just hire the newest photographer just because they are cheap and new. Look over their portfolio. They might not have many wedding photographs, so look at other portraits they have taken. Taking pictures of the human form is different from a stationary image, so make sure they have a solid portfolio of these pictures. You may just find you have found someone who will be going onto bigger and better things, you just happened to catch them at their early stages.\r\n\r\n## Print Your Photos\r\n\r\n![print your photos wedding](/posts/shutterstock_104450012.jpg)\r\n\r\nYour photographer will provide the option of printing out [photographs](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-tran/5-ways-to-save-money-on-a_b_3055500.html). They usually have the prints listed on the website and your family members can order prints from the photographer. This ads up quickly. Instead, you need to look towards printing out the photographs yourself. A quality photo printer now days costs very little and you can print out these pictures for yourself in your own home.\r\n\r\n## Go With a Friend\r\n\r\n![go with a friend wedding](/posts/shutterstock_153043517.jpg)\r\n\r\nSo you probably won’t receive the same beautiful quality you will with a professional. But it is a cheap option to go with and one thing to consider. If you are on a very tight budget for your photographs and wedding in general this might be your best option.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## VA Loan\r\n\r\nHave you served in the armed services? If so, there are all sorts of programs available to you. One such option is a VA loan. These loans don’t require any down payment if you are a qualified veteran or active duty service member. Some National Guard and U.S. Reserve members can qualify for this kind of a loan as well. With a VA loan, there is no mortgage insurance and you will pay a funding fee, although this can be rolled into the VA loan, so there really is no actual down payment at all. Additionally, VA loans typically have lower interest rates than your traditional mortgage, which makes it an extremely desirable loan. While the interest can change, it currently sits at a 2.15 percent for first time home buyers. If you are a reserve or National Guard member, the rate does go up to 2.4 percent. Either way, it makes enlisting and serving in the reserves all that more attractive, as you can save thousands of dollars over the course of your loan with the VA loan.\r\n\r\n## Navy Federal\r\n\r\n![Navy federal mortgage](/posts/shutterstock_267986684.jpg)\r\n\r\nYup, if you served in the armed forces you do have access to some pretty sweet no down payment mortgages. The Navy Federal Credit Union is one of them. Credit unions are typically better when it comes to loans, although these locations are also more exclusive. The credit union provides 100 percent financing when you qualify for buying a home. This loan is a bit more available than the VA loan though. It is open for members of the military, the U.S. Department of Defense, some civilian employees, and also family members of those who qualify. So, if you are the son or daughter of a veteran, you may qualify for this kind of a loan. Having a parent who served in the military not only can help them out but it is able to help you out as well. You will find many similarities between [Navy Federal and the VA loan](https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/buy-a-home-with-a-low-or-zero-down-payment/). The main difference though is the credit union has a 1.75 percent funding fee, which is less than what you would pay with the VA loan.\r\n\r\n## Mortgage Insurance\r\n\r\n![mortgage insurance](/posts/shutterstock_233493190.jpg)\r\n\r\nAlright, so you are not a military member and you either don’t qualify for the USDA loans (see below) or you didn’t find anything desirable in the set areas. Now what? Well, you can consider mortgage insurance. With this form of insurance you may be able to pay a down payment of as low as three percent. With the private mortgage insurance, you likely will find it costs substantially less than a FHA mortgage insurance. The thing about this is your private mortgage insurance does have much stricter credit needs. Due to this, your will be better off applying for this if you have a strong credit score. Not that anything is preventing you from applying regardless of your credit score, but you likely will only receive approval if you’re in strong standing. Another perk of going with the private mortgage insurance is that after you have paid off 20 percent of the home’s value, you can cancel the insurance. This means you’ll save even more money on your loan. With a traditional FHA mortgage insurance option, the only way you can adjust your insurance is if you refinance the amount into a non FHA loan.\r\n\r\n## USDA\r\n\r\n![USDA mortgage](/posts/shutterstock_364086071-1.jpg)\r\n\r\nAlright, so let’s say you didn’t serve in the military and you don’t have a family member who served. Does that mean you are completely out of luck when it comes to a low or no down payment mortgage? No, you still have some options. There is the USDA Rural Development mortgage. What kind of loan is this? The loan provides people who want to buy homes in typically rural areas are able to receive no down payment mortgages. However, it is more than just rural areas though. There are some eligible areas where you can receive a loan even if it isn’t farmland. In fact, you can check out the [USDA website](https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do?pageAction=sfp&NavKey=property@11) to see everywhere you may qualify for this no down payment mortgage. This mortgage is also designed for first time home buyers, so you can pick up the mortgage if you have never owned a home before. With this mortgage there is no mortgage insurance, although you will pay a two percent upfront fee. You can roll this into the total loan amount as you pay it back, so you won’t be forced to pay anything up front. There is also an annual guarantee fee of .5 percent of your loan balance.\r\n\r\n## The FHA\r\n\r\n![FHA mortgage](/posts/shutterstock_25708000.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs covered a bit above, the FHA allows you to land a down payment of around 3.5 percent. This is a half percentage point higher than the private mortgage insurance, but the credit restrictions are not as daunting. this means more people are able to qualify for this kind of mortgage. This way, even if you have a less than stellar credit score you might be able to land this low down payment option. When going with an FHA mortgage you will be charged an upfront premium of 1.75 percent. On top of this, there is a .85 percent annual premium placed on 30 year loans (15 year loans do not see this kind of premium).\r\n\r\n## The HomeReady Mortgage\r\n\r\n![HomeReady Mortgage mortgage](/posts/shutterstock_319421696.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis down payment sits right at three percent. Now, it is backed by Fannie Mae, which ran into some trouble a few years ago based on loans it handed out earlier, but in terms of a quality mortgage with a low down payment, it is difficult to find anything that is going to be better for you, especially if you don’t qualify for the other options.\r\n"

The Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO said to practice humility and restraint. He said it is always better, if you are feeling upset or strained to just hold back, keep your mouth shut, and see what tomorrow brings. For some this is easier to do than others, but the old saying of “cooler heads will prevail” is often the way to go, according to Warren Buffett, anyway.\r\n\r\n### Richard Branson\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4044\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4044\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Career tips Richard Branson](/posts/shutterstock_184133165.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4044\">[Krasimira_Nevenova](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-184133165/stock-photo-don-t-look-back-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nRichard Branson has created an empire, stretching from music stores to airlines and even space travel. He has done all of this while dropping out of school. His words of advice is to never look back and regret. Far too many people dwell in their past mistakes or their past glory. The problem here is it is in the past. What’s done is done. In order to be successful it is necessary to move on and onto the right thing.\r\n\r\n### Eric Schmidt\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4045\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4045\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Eric Schmidt career tips](/posts/shutterstock_290151644.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4045\">[ditty_about_summer](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-290151644/stock-photo-yes-concept-positive-changes-in-the-life-hands-holding-white-sign-on-the-sky-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nGoogle Executive Eric Schmidt gives the advice of “Say yes to more things.” Now, he doesn’t mean become a “yes” man, where you simply say yes to everything. Instead, say yes to things you normally wouldn’t. Maybe it is going out with friends when you would usually stay home or taking on a new task because it is out of your comfort zone. This will expand your comfort zone, expose you to more people and take you to new career heights.\r\n\r\n### Mark Bartels\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4046\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4046\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![mark bartels career tips](/posts/shutterstock_192589274.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4046\">[Syda_Productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-192589274/stock-photo-summer-holidays-vacation-and-happiness-concept-group-of-friends-taking-selfie-with-smartphone.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMark is the CEO of StumbleUpon. His advice is to take time for yourself. He knows it is easy too just spend so much time in your profession that you miss out on life. This not only takes away from the time you are on the planet, but it also burns you out faster. Instead, do what you love but also take time to enjoy the little things in life that make you happy.\r\n\r\n### T.J.

Miller is an actor and comedian who appears on several hit HBO shows. He says to simply work harder than everyone else around you. If someone is working harder than you, they will be the ones getting better and nabbing the promotions. So, do the little things, focus on the big picture and always go beyond what others do. This sets you apart.\r\n\r\n### Suze Orman\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4048\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4048\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Suze Orman career tips](/posts/shutterstock_335150339.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4048\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-335150339/stock-photo-businesswoman-stressed-out-at-work-in-casual-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSuze is a motivational speaker, author, and television host. She said that as you move up the ladder you’ll receive more and more unhelpful criticism. Her advice is to simply ignore it. It is far to easy to just start listening to the naysayers, become angry, or to let it hurt you. Instead, just block out the unhelpful criticism. You’ll learn along the way how to identify what is helpful and what is unhelpful. Once you do, block the unhelpful out.\r\n\r\n### J.K. Rowling\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4049\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4049\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![J.K.

Rowling says to embrace your failure. She has given speeches about how she had failed in life and found herself at rock bottom. But her ability to embrace her failure and to spur herself into her one true passion made her what she is today. As J.K. Rowling points out, everyone fails, yet it is often seen as a negative. It only really is a negative if someone takes it as one. You can transform it into a positive and let it push you to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\n### George Stephanopoulos\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4050\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4050\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![George Stephanopoulos career tips](/posts/shutterstock_299059379.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4050\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-299059379/stock-photo-businessman-relaxing-in-swivel-chair-in-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nHost of Good Morning America, his advice is to simply relax. As he puts it, what is affecting you today is likely not going to affect you tomorrow or a week down the road, so don’t let it stress you out. The only thing stress is going to do is cause more stress, health problems and take you away from the good things you’re experiencing.\r\n\r\n### Alexa von Tabel\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4051\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4051\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![career tips Alexa von Tabel](/posts/shutterstock_315886505.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4051\">[Antonio_Guillem](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-315886505/stock-photo-happy-wake-up-of-a-happy-man-lying-on-the-bed-and-stopping-alarm-clock.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAlexa is the founder and CEO of LearnVest, not to mention a New York Times bestselling author. According to Alexa, it is important to wake up excited, dress the part you’re aiming for (not the part you have) and to always show up, ready to go. This shows you’re ready to take on the world and ready to reach higher to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\n### Salli Setta\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4052\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4052\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Salli Setta career tips](/posts/shutterstock_325950809.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4052\">[VP_Photo_Studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-325950809/stock-photo-three-business-people-having-meeting-in-outdoor-restaurant.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPresident of Red Lobster, Salli Setta says to never eat lunch alone.

If you ask your account holder they most likely will tell you to go for it. Why? Because they make money off of it. It’s like asking the oil change garage if you need to rotate your tires? Of course they’ll say yes. It’s more money in their pocket. Instead, by asking an outsider with knowledge about it, you’ll receive an honest answer.\r\n\r\n### Do Be Credit Savvy\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3752\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3752\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![12 credit savvy investment](/posts/12-credit-savvy-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3752\">[andrey_popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-282625841/stock-photo-close-up-of-a-businessman-checking-credit-score-online-on-cellphone-while-having-coffee.htm)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCredit is important in everything, including investing. As interest rates begin to climb, you need to be more credit savvy now than any time in the last several years.\r\n\r\n### Do Create a Plan\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3753\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3753\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![13 create a plan investment](/posts/13-create-a-plan-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3753\">[looker_studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-318574799/stock-photo-mix-coins-with-seed-in-clear-bottle-on-white-background-business-investment-growth-concept-saving.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile you shouldn’t set money goals based in time, you should have a plan. So, when you start from point A and reach point B, you know what to do to reach point C.\r\n\r\n### Do Your Research\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3754\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3754\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![14 research investment](/posts/14-research-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3754\">[lenestan](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-62529934/stock-photo-magnifying-glass-over-financial-newspaper.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMake sure to put in your research. The more prepared you are about a specific investment opportunity the fewer risks will come up and surprise you.\r\n\r\n### Do Pay Attention to Fees\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3755\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3755\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![15 investment fees](/posts/15-investment-fees.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3755\">[zerbor](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-379140319/stock-photo-coin-stacks-with-letter-dice-fees.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFees can really start to add up when you look at investing. These kinds of fees are liable to end up costing you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars annually. All of this is money that should be in your pocket, but it isn’t. So, look carefully at the fees and see what they are going for. This also means you need to read the fine print on the paperwork. It may just end up saving you a large sum of money.\r\n\r\n### Do Take Risks\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3756\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3756\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![16 investment risk](/posts/16-investment-risk.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3756\">[skylines](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-367446221/stock-photo-the-tower-from-wooden-blocks-and-man-s-hand-take-one-block.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt can pay off to take risks. If signs point to yes, but it isn’t for sure, take some risks. The ones that pay off more than pay for the ones that don’t.\r\n\r\n### Do Play Catch Up\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3757\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3757\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![17 catch up investment](/posts/17-catch-up-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3757\">[andreas_saldavs](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-177560813/stock-photo-seniors-using-tablet-and-smart-phone.html?)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you started investing late, that is all right. It never is too late to start investing, so do what you can to catch up.\r\n\r\n### Do Remember Taxes\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3758\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3758\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![18 taxes investment](/posts/18-taxes-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3758\">[kudla](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-246831286/stock-photo-stressed-over-bills-surprised-young-woman-looking-at-her-financial-debts-in-the-kitchen-at-home.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is something that can really catch up with you later. Depending on the investments you may need to pay only when you withdraw and cash in investments or whenever interest is gained. Put money away for taxes to protect yourself.\r\n\r\n### Do Contribute\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3759\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3759\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![19 contribute investment](/posts/19-contribute-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3759\">[david_crockett](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-239252/stock-photo-looking-at-stocks.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAlways contribute to your retirement funds and if your employer offer a matching investment opportunity make sure to take it.\r\n\r\n### Do Keep Your Job\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3760\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3760\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![20 keep your job investment](/posts/20-keep-your-job-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3760\">[rawpixel.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-246902041/stock-photo-business-people-rush-hour-walking-commuting-city-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nPerhaps you strike it big on an investment. It is a great feeling, but don’t quit your job. You never know when another investment might go way south.\r\n"

Make a list of the things you love about it. Then make a list of the things you hate about it. Make sure that it’s the career itself that is causing you dissatisfaction and not the job environment, your coworkers or your particular job. Establish a clear picture of what you want to take with you on your next career and what you wish to leave behind.\r\n\r\n### Ditch Your Excuses\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4012\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4012\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![ditch excuse career](/posts/shutterstock_313134140.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4012\">[Dirk_Eckerman](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-313134140/stock-photo-no-excuses-tell-the-truth-take-responsibility-and-have-no-regrets-stop-lying-being-responsible.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou can probably think of a dozen reasons why you shouldn’t make that career change. Instead, make a list of why you should change your career at this point in your life. How will it benefit you and your family, in the long run? At this stage, think about what you want to do instead of nagging at yourself about why you should remain where you are.\r\n\r\n### Determine Your Priorities\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4013\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4013\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![priorities career](/posts/shutterstock_314490425.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4013\">[Gustavo_Frazao](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-314490425/stock-photo-hand-with-marker-writing-the-word-priorites.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nList five main priorities that are important to you. Do you want to maintain good relationships with your friends and family? Do you want meaningful work that earns a steady income? Do you want to have the time and money to take fun vacations once or twice a year? Where would you like to retire? Ask yourself these and other questions and write them down. Then step away for a few days before you go back and look at your answers again. Do these answers still carry the same importance?\r\n\r\n### Focus on Your Strengths and Weaknesses\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4014\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4014\" style=\"width: 3500px\">\r\n\r\n![strengths and weakness career](/posts/shutterstock_244227358.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4014\">[enciktepstudio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244227358/stock-photo-business-man-pointing-on-jigsaw-written-swot.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou probably already know what your strengths and weaknesses are. If you’re unsure, jot down a list of the things you have accomplished in your life and what you did to succeed. Do the same with your weaknesses, and think about the times you failed at a task and why. Soon, you will see a pattern emerge, which will give you an idea of what type of career you’re best suited for. You may be a natural leader. You may have a natural creative flair. You may work best independently or with a team.\r\n\r\n### Discover Your Passion\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4015\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4015\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![discover passion career](/posts/shutterstock_130099706.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4015\">[ASDF_MEDIA](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-130099706/stock-photo-business-people-shaking-hands-finishing-up-a-meeting.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDon’t launch into a new career before you’re sure that it’s something that you’re going to love to do. Otherwise, you will find yourself in the same rut. Take some time to learn about yourself, what skills you find fun and satisfying and what you naturally enjoy. Educate yourself about this career path and determine whether this passion is better suited as a hobby. You can do this by talking to people who work in your desired field. What do they like about their career? What are the pitfalls? Do the highlights outweigh those pitfalls?\r\n\r\n### Have a Sound Financial Plan\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4016\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4016\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![sound financial plan career](/posts/shutterstock_374311897.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4016\">[Lemau_studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-374311897/stock-photo-financial-plan-written-on-wooden-table-with-clock-dice-calculator-pen-and-compass.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is especially important if you are thinking about starting your own business. Most new businesses take five years to succeed, if they do succeed. Do you have a backup plain in case your venture fails? Do you have enough assets to cover the your living expenses until you are able to make a good living? This question also applies if you have taken a job that makes less money than your old one. You might discover that it will take a few years to be able to make this transition, but don’t get discouraged.\r\n\r\n### Utilize Your Experience\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4017\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4017\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![utilize experience career](/posts/shutterstock_265594196.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4017\">[goodluz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-265594196/stock-photo-teacher-helping-students-on-project.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe best part about switching careers in your 40s is that you have years of experience and an impressive portfolio to offer. Even if you lack experience in the career field you are pursuing, your previous experience is still quite relevant. Your work history will showcase your credibility and show prospective employers what characteristics and attributes previous employers valued in you. Make sure to highlight your previous achievements, even if they seem trivial.\r\n\r\n### Get the Experience That You May Lack\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4018\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4018\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![obtain experience career](/posts/shutterstock_86444413.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4018\">[bikeworldtravel](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-86444413/stock-photo-one-east-asian-woman-study-in-the-local-library.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nChances are, you will need some form of training before you transition into a new career. If that’s the case, you can check out your local colleges to see if they have any night or weekend classes available. You can also gain experience by volunteering or applying for an internship. This will help you test the waters and see if this change is right for you.\r\n\r\n### Make Use of Your Old Personal and Business Contacts\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4020\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4020\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![use old business and persona; contacts career](/posts/shutterstock_344966660.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4020\">[uber_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-344966660/stock-photo-black-business-man-using-cell-phone-white-and-black-business-woman-in-background.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nCall old friends and colleagues that you haven’t spoken to in a while and get reacquainted. You might learn that one or more of them have made the same transition as you’re attempting. If that’s the case, then they can help you by providing you with insider information that will help you avoid beginner mistakes when starting your own business. This can help make your transition easier. If you are looking to land a position with another company and they happen to work there, you will have a better chance of landing that interview and securing that position.\r\n\r\n### Take the Leap\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4021\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4021\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![take the leap career](/posts/shutterstock_309131933.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4021\">[Hootsuite-beeboys](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-309131933/stock-photo-business-man-jump-with-blue-sky-full-length-asian-male.html?src=oaXC_C_LLplx1Vh1tibsqA-1-7)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve determined that you can financially support yourself during this transition, you are ready to take the leap. Don’t let the fear of failure hold you back. Take the chance and see what happens. Chances are great that you will grow personally and professionally, whether or not you succeed. Venturing into a new territory will help you regain your zest for life.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n## Include Lines Layman Won’t Understand\r\n\r\nYou are very careful about crafting your resume and want to make sure the reader understands the message you are conveying. So, while creating a resume you include technical terms regarding your [career path](https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/08/13/10-reasons-your-resume-isnt-getting-you-interviews). This includes the job title, what your job requirements were and what you did on the job. The problem with using technical terms is the average layman might now know what you’re talking about.\r\n\r\nYou don’t want to dumb down the document, but you still need to make sure it is easily understandable by those who read over it. For starters, your current job may use rather odd titles for jobs. If the title is not universally understood, you need to simply alter the title to something that is understandable. The title of your job should not hold you back because others are not able to understand what you did. This is important because not only humans read your resume but scanning software. If your job title doesn’t include the specific keywords a company is looking for, your resume ends up in the trash.\r\n\r\nNow, you should not lie about your job title. Instead, you can include an alternative title. This way, you can include the title that the layman will understand and a secondary title of what your job goes by. So, if they call your current (or previous) employer with questions, they know what job title to ask about.\r\n\r\n## Non Explanation Gaps\r\n\r\n![non explanation gaps resume](/posts/shutterstock_217401814.jpg)\r\n\r\nIdeally, your resume lists all your positions without any real extensive gaps. Maybe you took a month off or it took you a year to find work. That is fine and most who check over your resume are able to understand this. However, it becomes suspect if you have multiple gaps in the resume or long term singular gaps. You don’t want to leave these gaps blank and yet you don’t want to make up time you worked at a particular company to fill in these blanks. After all, if the potential new employer calls about this, they will find out you padded your resume and lying about your resume right off the bat is a bad look and will likely prevent you from receiving a call back.\r\n\r\nSo what should you do about these gaps of employment? The best way around this is to simply tell the truth. You can note the gaps at the top of your resume or at the base with a footnote. Perhaps you relocated with your spouse, so with the course of moving and leaving your previous job, you didn’t land a new job for six months or a year. Finding a job cold turkey in a new market is often tricky and most who look over your resume will understand. If you took a year off traveling, include this as well. Some jobs may actually find this desirable as travel gains you experience in other cultures you can’t obtain on the job. So, stay honest and include the reasoning behind these extended gaps. It will fill in why you were not working and potentially make you more desirable.\r\n\r\n## Remember the Bullets\r\n\r\n![remember the bullets resume](/posts/shutterstock_142881133.jpg)\r\n\r\nYour resume, no matter how amazing, needs to be easily scannable. This means you need to include bullet points and short lines. It makes it easier for the basics of your resume to be absorbed by the person who is reading it.\r\n\r\n## Poor Location\r\n\r\n![poor location](/posts/shutterstock_295156754.jpg)\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with applying for a dream job or a job in a different city. However, this can cause some problems. If you live in Gary, Indiana and start applying for jobs in San Diego, Maui or other spots, those reading through your resume might assume you want the company to pay for travel expenses, which can add up. Outside of upper-tier management positions or executive spots, the company will likely not want to pay for your moving fees. And unless your resume is off the charts better than everyone else, they probably will look past your resume, all because of your poor location address. You don’t want the company you apply to instantly have all sorts of concerns about you. The resume is about ironing out concerns and making you look attractive, not a potential issue waiting to happen. So, what in the world are you suppose to do? You have a job you know you are qualified for in a different market, but nobody is calling you back because of your address?\r\n\r\nThe first step is to indicate why you are looking at the position and the destination. You should also include that the move to the current location is already in the works (even if it isn’t). This way, they know you are not looking for moving fees to be covered and they will not have the worry of you moving across the country, only to possibly hate the job and quit. There are a few different ways you can discuss this sort of information, with one of the best as including it in your cover letter. Your cover letter is all about introducing you, so you might as well point out why you are applying for this long distance job. It can help clear up concerns your possible employer might have. If you are still worried about the address listed on your resume, consider asking a friend in the area (if you have one in the desired location) if you can use their address.\r\n\r\n## That One Glaring Error\r\n\r\n![resume one glaring error](/posts/shutterstock_384985675.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou have read something so many times it makes your head numb. However, this is the problem. You wrote the document and know what it says. So you actually skim over it while you read it. This means you can miss some glaring errors that need correcting. Take a break, then go back and re-read your resume or better yet give it a friend to read.\r\n"

Writing up your report, checking your email, and doing jobs at once actually slows you down. Instead of doing one job quickly, you do three or four jobs slowly and less efficiently. There are times you need to multitask, but most of the time it is more of a detriment than helpful.\r\n\r\n### Overcommitting\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3975\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3975\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 Overcommitting sabotaging your career](/posts/2-Overcommitting-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3975\">[hidsey](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-261869786/stock-photo-super-busy-calendar-stress.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAt the office, you probably want to show the hire ups you are willing to go the extra mile. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you can handle the workload. If the productivity begins to suffer, or the quality of your work goes down, you need to reduce what you commit to. By doing so, you allow yourself to focus on what is at hand, devote more time to each and ensure you deliver the highest quality work possible. You want your bosses to see the quality of your work, not you handing in less than stellar material time and time again.\r\n\r\n### Over Complain\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3977\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3977\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 Over Complain sabotaging your career](/posts/3-Over-Complain-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3977\">[photographee.eu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-418045876/stock-photo-angry-young-man-complaining-his-psychologist-about-his-problems.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEvery office has that one person who just complains about everything. This individual has a negative attitude and it can bring down the rest of the office. Don’t be this person. It is fine if you don’t like a particular task or have issue with certain things, but limit your verbal complaints to really important matters. Focus on the positives at the work place instead of the negatives.\r\n\r\n### Make Excuses\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3978\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3978\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Make Excuses sabotaging your career](/posts/4-Make-Excuses-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3978\">[eenevski](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-431537488/stock-photo-stop-excuses-text-concept-isolated-over-white-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nExcuses are excuses. If you don’t finish something, don’t lay on the excuses. It makes you look incapable of taking responsibility. Instead, you need to simply take responsibility. This is a much more attractive quality than being able to worm yourself out of a bad situation. Plus, most employers are able to see through the excuses.\r\n\r\n### Show Up Late\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3979\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3979\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 Show Up Late sabotaging your career](/posts/5-Show-Up-Late-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3979\">[Master1305](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-308552396/stock-photo-the-chinese-man-as-businessman-with-a-briefcase-running-in-a-city-street-on-a-background-of-red.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing that can derail your career faster than anything else it is showing up late constantly. This shows you are not dependable, are unable to adhere to a work schedule and it also demonstrates to not only your boss but others around you that your time is more valuable than everyone else. Accidents happen from time to time, there is no question about it, but once that accident happens two or three times, it no longer is an accident.\r\n\r\n### Try to Please Everyone\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3980\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3980\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Try to Please Everyone sabotaging your career](/posts/6-Try-to-Please-Everyone-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3980\">[Monkey_Business_Images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-129636062/stock-photo-workers-in-distribution-warehouse.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nNow, if you are an intern or a personal assistant, it is your job to do what people tell you to do and to make them happy. Many professionals start out in one of these positions, so there is nothing wrong with that. However, once you move higher up, you can’t be someone who simply tries to please everyone. You need to have a voice and you also need to set your foot down from time to time. If there is something you need to critique and you believe it is for the best of the company and the person, tell them. Of course, some people require a bit more tact to critique than others, so you may need to learn the best way to discuss these kinds of situations with them, but don’t just ignore mistakes or issues because you want to make them happy.\r\n\r\n### Apologize For Everything\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3981\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3981\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Apologize For Everything sabotaging your career](/posts/7-Apologize-For-Everything-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3981\">[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-241322035/stock-photo-closeup-portrait-desperate-young-man-showing-clasped-hands-pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf there is a general mistake, than sure, say you are sorry when it affects someone else. However, saying sorry too much can make you look weak and can cause other problems, as well. Your boss may become burned out on your apologies. You may not even realize you are doing this, so try to analyze yourself and what you say on a daily basis. If you find yourself saying sorry too much, try to cut it out.\r\n\r\n### Talk Down To Yourself\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3982\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3982\" style=\"width: 3500px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Talk Down To Yourself sabotaging your career](/posts/8-Talk-Down-To-Yourself-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3982\">[ivy_photos](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-148780343/stock-photo-depressed-girl-holding-her-face-grey-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou need to be your biggest supporter. If you don’t believe in yourself, who will? You need to have confidence in yourself. You may not have a big head and you might not want to come across as overconfident, which is fine, but you should still, at least internally, talk yourself up. Don’t attack yourself. You should defend yourself. So, if you complete something, stand behind it and don’t belittle yourself.\r\n\r\n### Information Overload\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3983\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3983\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Information Overload sabotaging your career](/posts/9-Information-Overload-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3983\">[Alex_Po](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-369093563/stock-photo-man-under-stress-because-of-too-much-problems-abstract-image-with-a-wooden-puppet.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEver take in too much information you just can’t concentrate on one thing? This is information overload. Try not to go overboard with the information for certain tasks. Yes, knowledge is power, but in doses. Take on the information for the job at hand. Otherwise you’ll kill your productivity.\r\n\r\n### Make All the Decisions\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3984\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3984\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Make All the Decisions sabotaging your career](/posts/10-Make-All-the-Decisions-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3984\">[Kheng_Guan_Toh](https://ww.shutterstock.com/pic-327385208/stock-photo-background-concept-wordcloud-illustration-of-analysis-paralysis.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you are making every single decision, it can eventually lead to procrastination and low work productivity. There is such thing as decision fatigue. Let other people make decisions from time to time. Whether it is picking out lunch or the order of your reports. It is an actual relief when someone else takes charge.\r\n\r\n### Being a Flake\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3985\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3985\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11 Being a Flake sabotaging your career](/posts/11-Being-a-Flake-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3985\">[Corepics_VOF](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-46625671/stock-photo-laid-back-receptionist-taking-a-call-not-too-seriously.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you say you were going to do something or show up for a dinner or accompany someone to a pitch, don’t flake out. Nobody likes a flake. Sure, there might be a billion different things you’d rather do, but you told someone you’d help out. You gave them your word, and as soon as you show they can’t take you for your word, you are more or less worthless to them as they can no longer count on you. The last thing you want to be is someone nobody can count on (that will kill your career right there). So, if you say you’re going to do something, do it.\r\n"

Being perceived as attractive does seem to help push you towards becoming wealthy. It actually helps men more so than women. According to the American Economic Review, men who are seen as attractive make nine percent more than unattractive men. This number is much lower for women, as attractive women earn four percent more than unattractive women.\r\n\r\n### The Popular Kids\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3992\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3992\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 The Popular Kids rich](/posts/2-The-Popular-Kids-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3992\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-119443741/stock-photo-students-sitting-clinking-cups-while-smiling-in-college-cafe.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIndividuals who were popular in high school typically make 10 percent more than people who weren’t. There are many reasons behind why this might be the case. First, often the popular kids have wealthier families, which means they are able to afford higher-end educations. This can help land a better job and push them higher up the ladder. On the other hand, some people are popular simply because they are great with other people and make friends easily. Both can help individuals make more money and potentially become rich one day.\r\n\r\n### College Matters\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3993\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3993\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 College Matters rich](/posts/3-College-Matters-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3993\">[cdrin](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-143473063/stock-photo-harvard-street-sign-with-a-classic-red-brick-building-in-the-background-location-harvard.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSome people might say where you go to college doesn’t matter, but in reality, it does. For example, someone who graduates from Dartmouth College is going to earn 162 percent more than someone who went to East Texas Baptist University. A higher-tier college comes with stature, and it is likely to help someone land a better job off of the name recognition alone. This just points to why going to a better college can in fact help you strike it rich one day. There is a reason many individuals who hold top jobs hold degrees from top universities and colleges.\r\n\r\n### Strive to Be Tall\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3994\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3994\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Strive to Be Tall rich](/posts/4-Strive-to-Be-Tall-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3994\">[Franck_Boston](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-44593291/stock-photo-young-couple-back-to-back-trying-to-talk-isolated-on-white.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis one can be rolled up with the [looks category](https://www.businessinsider.com/15-signs-you-will-be-rich-2010-10?op=1). Taller people are more likely to make more money than shorter people. According to The Economic Record, women will earn anywhere from five to eight percent more for every three inches taller they are. For men, this number ranges from four to 10 percent more for every three inches. It is interesting, with so many beauty standards placed on women, men are the ones who are seemingly penalized more for their looks. An attractive man who is six inches taller than someone who is perceived as less attractive may make 29 percent more.\r\n\r\n### Stay Married\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3995\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3995\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 Stay Married rich](/posts/5-Stay-Married-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3995\">[gpointstudio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-287991707/stock-photo-happy-senior-couple-on-te-sofa.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBeing married and staying married can drastically help boost your net worth. In fact, someone who is married and stays married will increase their worth by 77 percent. Someone who stays married increases their average wealth by 16 percent every single year. While this doesn’t mean you should go out and try to get hitched right now, it does show the power and perception of marriage on others around you.\r\n\r\n### Cheers\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3996\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3996\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Cheers rich](/posts/6-Cheers-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3996\">[Monkey_Business_Images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-238694314/stock-photo-group-of-friends-enjoying-evening-drinks-in-bar.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile there is nothing wrong with turning down another round, someone who drinks is going to earn 10 to 14 percent more than those who don’t. This is because of the social aspect that comes with drinking. It helps bring together, not to mention deals and business agreements are often formed over drinks. So while you don’t need to be a heavy drinker, having a glass or two can help you ultimately become rich.\r\n\r\n### Degree Matters\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3997\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3997\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Degree Matters rich](/posts/7-Degree-Matters-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3997\">[Tom_Wang](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-177569810/stock-photo-businessman-cooperate-with-different-industries-people.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis probably comes as no surprise, but the kind of degree you have matters. Someone who has a Bachelor’s degree in engineering is going to earn substantially more than someone in family studies. If you have a passion for something you shouldn’t fight it, as you may end up unhappy in the end, but some career paths are simply going to lead to more money than others.\r\n\r\n### Drop the BMI\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3998\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3998\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Drop the BMI rich](/posts/8-Drop-the-BMI-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3998\">[designer491](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-283177196/stock-photo-bmi-body-mass-index-formula-rate-formula-in-a-notepad.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nA person’s body mass index takes into account several different variables to determine their desirable weight. For every unit someone increases over their desired BMI, they see a drop off in income by eight percent. This is an average overall, yet it affects the sexes differently. While height and beauty affects men more, BMI drastically affects women more. Women see a 12 percent drop in wealth per point, while white men see a drop in only two percent.\r\n\r\n### Have a Russian Ancestor\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3999\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3999\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Have a Russian Ancestor rich](/posts/9-Have-a-Russian-Ancestor-rich-e1470687289980.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3999\">[gusenych](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-423993283/stock-vector-icon-made-in-russia-on-the-flag-of-russia.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is something you can’t really make up. You either have someone or you don’t. If you do, it is a really good sign you’ll likely make it rich. Why? Because 22 percent of households in the United States with a Russian ancestor has a net worth of over $1 million. That is by far higher than any other background.\r\n\r\n### Invest in Real Estate Young\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4000\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4000\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Invest in Real Estate Young rich](/posts/10-Invest-in-Real-Estate-Young-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4000\">[goodluz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-103885106/stock-photo-couple-in-real-estate-agency-talking-to-construction-planner.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nInvest in real estate when you’re young. Real estate is one of the best ways to make money as it is more recession proof than most other forms of investments and it will continually bring money in. The younger you invest in real estate the better the sign of you eventually striking it rich.\r\n\r\n### Go Blonde\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4001\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4001\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11 Go Blonde rich](/posts/11-Go-Blonde-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4001\">[loftflow](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-363900452/stock-photo-cropped-shot-view-of-young-female-student-learning-on-line-on-her-laptop-computer-lovely-young.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is specifically for women, but blonde women make about seven percent more than non blond women. Also, in a rather interesting twist, men who marry blonde women actually make six percent more than men who don’t marry blonde women. So, having a blonde wife actually increases a couple’s net worth by 13 percent.\r\n\r\n### Ditch the Cigs\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4002\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4002\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![12 Ditch the Cigs rich](/posts/12-Ditch-the-Cigs-rich.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4002\">[ChameleonsEye](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-110076689/stock-photo-concept-photo-of-a-man-quitting-smoking-by-breaking-a-cigarette.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you currently smoke, it might be time to quit. Non-smokers have a net worth of 50 percent more than light smokers and make 100 percent more than heavy smokers. If your health isn’t a factor in helping you quit smoking, the amount of money you miss out on should be. This is one of the factors you do have a say in.\r\n"

If you are not able to provide the lowest price for similar quality services, the individual or business will likely go with what is less expensive. Unless you can make a better offer next time, isn’t much you can do.\r\n\r\n### Didn’t Understand the Work\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3952\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3952\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 Didn't Understand the Work competition](/posts/2-Didnt-Understand-the-Work-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3952\">[Amdrey_Poppov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-70048396/stock-photo-group-of-disoriented-businesspeople.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you are [meeting a potential client](https://hbr.org/2012/09/top-reasons-salespeople-lose-b) for the first time you need to know them, know their goals and what they strive to do. Of course, as an outsider you will be forced to make a few assumptions, although the more research you put into it the better. If you fail to completely understand what the individual or business you are pitching to is going after, they will go with a different service provider.\r\n\r\n### Not Compliant With the Account Holder\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3953\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3953\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 Not Compliant With the Account Holder competition](/posts/3-Not-Compliant-With-the-Account-Holder-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3953\">[Pressmaster](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-158522279/stock-photo-image-of-two-young-businessmen-using-touchpad-at-meeting.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is another one you don’t have full control over, but you can reduce problems with through company research. The company you propose your pitch to may have very specific formatting requirements and other organizational styling that you do not fit into. You’d be surprised how often an account is picked because the formatting is better suited. This is also why proper research is a must.\r\n\r\n### Solutions For a Problem That Doesn’t Exist\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3954\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3954\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Solutions For a Problem That Doesn't Exist competition](/posts/4-Solutions-For-a-Problem-That-Doesnt-Exist-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3954\">[g-stockstudio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-226425211/stock-photo-boring-presentation-group-of-young-business-people-in-smart-casual-wear-looking-bored-while.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen you pitch for a new account, you often pitch ways to fix a problem the company likely has. However, what if they don’t have that problem you’re discussing? They have no reason to go with you. Again, research into this company and knowing it inside and out can help you discover problems the company likely has so you can pitch ways to fix them.\r\n\r\n### A Major Mistake\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3955\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3955\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 A Major Mistake competition](/posts/5-A-Major-Mistake-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3955\">[flil](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-301395722/stock-photo--accounting-accounting-documents-a-cup-of-strong-coffee-tables-of-numbers-calculator-top-view.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSometimes you are not given a direct answer to why you didn’t land the account. However, you may receive an answer saying your pitch didn’t make it into an evaluation committee. This means they just did not like your pitch at all. When this is the case, they either just don’t like you and your company, or you made a rather substantial error during the pitch. These errors can be anything from substantial typos, missing documents, confusing the company for another. If you don’t make the evaluation committee you probably made a big mistake. Sometimes with these it is better to look it over, see if you can find out what you did wrong and move on.\r\n\r\n### Marginally Qualified\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3956\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3956\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Marginally Qualified competition](/posts/6-Marginally-Qualified-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3956\">[dotstock](https://ww.shutterstock.com/pic-154536812/stock-photo-portrait-of-tired-young-business-woman-at-the-office.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf the account says you were marginally qualified it means you didn’t pitch your qualifications well enough. Next time around, emphasize your qualifications and why you can do something better than the competition.\r\n\r\n### The Other Company Was Recommended\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3957\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3957\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 The Other Company Was Recommended competition](/posts/7-The-Other-Company-Was-Recommended-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3957\">[Wright_studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-351001487/stock-photo-businessman-pressing-button-on-touch-screen-interface-and-select-recommended.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is something you can’t do much about either. Your [competition](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140914141243-5572608-top-ten-reasons-why-you-really-lost-that-bid) may have simply been recommended by an associate or a business partner. Unless your pitch completely wows them, the potential account holder will be more likely to take the recommendation from someone who has worked with the company for years instead of take a risk on you. Nothing you can do about that but provide quality services to your current accounts and hope they recommend you.\r\n\r\n### “Satisfactory References”\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3958\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3958\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Satisfactory References competition](/posts/8-Satisfactory-References-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3958\">[imtmphoto](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-379643950/stock-photo-caucasian-business-executive-praising-subordinate-by-giving-a-pat-on-the-shoulder.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSo what exactly does this mean? It means you provided a list of references to the potential account holder but did not get in touch with the references to coach them into what to say. Now, you should never feed words into the mouths of your current contracts and account holders, but if the account holder is caught off guard with someone asking questions about you, they may not give the best off the cuff answers. So, always notify your references ahead of time.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Have the Experience\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3959\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3959\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Don't Have the Experience competition](/posts/9-Dont-Have-the-Experience-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3959\">[Michael_Kowalski](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-115641427/stock-photo-stressed-and-worried-attractive-junior-businesswoman-and-senior-businessman-holding-their-heads.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nJust keep chugging along. You’ll get the experience. However, sometimes if the account holder wants extensive experience and that is their main buying point, you can’t do much (outside of hiring on new professionals into the company to increase experience years).\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3960\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3960\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Risk competition](/posts/10-Risk-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3960\">[Bildagentur_Zoonar_GmbH](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-233621905/stock-photo-risk-analysis.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSometimes someone you pitch to sees a potential risk going with your service. Maybe you are not as large or maybe you don’t have the experience. They want to feel comfortable with the lesser qualities of your company. To do this, turn your risks into an advantage. Pitch as a smaller company with fewer clients you can spend more time on their individual needs and without aged individuals bringing experience you can keep costs down with lower salaries. There is a way to spin just about everything to make you look better.\r\n\r\n### Ineffective Message\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3961\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3961\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11a Ineffective Message competition](/posts/11a-Ineffective-Message-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3961\">[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-295421723/stock-photo-frustrated-handsome-young-business-man-in-suit-receiving-bad-news-message-on-mobile-smart-phone.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYour pitch may just have not connected with the account holder. Look over your pitch, go through it and see what you can change. Feel free to ask what they didn’t like about your pitch. You may discover what you need to change right off the bat.\r\n\r\n### Executive Problems\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3962\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3962\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11b Executive Problems competition](/posts/11b-Executive-Problems-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3962\">[Matej_Kastelic](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-274821560/stock-photo-business-man-making-a-presentation-at-office-business-executive-delivering-a-presentation-to-his.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen pitching a service you need to understand the other company not by sheer numbers, but by how its executive or manager sees the company. Look at it from their perspective. It will make it easier to pitch in the future as you understand what they are looking for.\r\n\r\n### Beating the Incumbent\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3963\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3963\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![12 Beating the Incumbent competition](/posts/12-Beating-the-Incumbent-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3963\">[ASDF_Media](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-130099715/stock-photo-business-handshake.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe incumbent always has the advantage. People know the incumbent, they understand what they receive and there are fewer risks involved. It is why a president is more likely to receive a second term. Because people know what to expect. It is difficult to beat the incumbent, so you need to make your best pitch to do so.\r\n\r\n### Connection With Them\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3964\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3964\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![13 Connection With Them competition](/posts/13-Connection-With-Them-competition.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3964\">[Monkey_Business_Images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-124547059/stock-photo-businessman-and-businesswoman-shaking-hands-in-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou need to connect with the account holder. This might be as easy as taking them to the right restaurant for lunch or dressing a certain way. There are little connections you need to make when making a pitch. It often is the little things that count when making a connection.\r\n"

Look towards [high dividend paying stocks](https://fortune.com/2015/09/02/8-ways-the-average-investor-can-make-money-in-this-wild-stock-market/). There are companies that pay profit sharing dividends with investors, which may be annually or quarterly. Either way, this is an investment you can cash in any time while also netting yourself money throughout the year.\r\n\r\n### Recurring Deposits\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3921\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3921\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2a recurring deposits](/posts/2a-recurring-deposits.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3921\">[Yellowj](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=49505614&src=lb-47887803)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis not only is a way to make money quickly through the market, but it also comes with very little risk. These provide a high rate of interest and you can use it similar to a savings account. You should always have money on hand for your next investment, and putting the money into this kind of an account with grow your money exponentially faster than the other options out there.\r\n\r\n### Play With Time Zones\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3917\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3917\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 Play With Time Zones](/posts/3-Play-With-Time-Zones.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3917\">[mastermilmar](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-351498674/stock-photo-a-row-of-clocks-in-an-airport-with-a-variety-of-times-shown-for-major-cities.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nLook toward both Asian and Europe to see how the United States market will open. When these markets perform well, there is a good chance the U.S. market will open up. This sets you up for what you might want to do. By knowing the stock market is going to shoot up, you can buy quickly early on, let it ride up and then sell. If you day trade, this can help you outsmart the market by just time zone watching.\r\n\r\n### Opening and Closing\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3918\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3918\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Opening and Closing](/posts/4-Opening-and-Closing.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3918\">[who_is_danny](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-351142058/stock-photo-businessman-grabs-the-head-in-open-space-office-with-business-chart-at-the-wall.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the time zone feature. Buying and selling at the beginning and ending of the day is a good idea because most prices for a stock at the start and end of a day are based on sentiment and how people feel about the stock, not based on the company itself. This is another day trading technique\r\n\r\n### Pre-Market Forecast\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3920\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3920\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![pre market forecast](/posts/5a-pre-market-forecast.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3920\">[worradirek](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-89303113/stock-photo-business-woman-open-hand-showing-graph-in-stock-exchange-board.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe time zone game isn’t the only bit of pre-market information you need to check out. Check how stocks are trading early on. While the price won’t vary yet, you can see how much is going into the market. If European, and more importantly Asian, markets are closing up and the pre market trading is up, you know the market will likely continue up (the same with down markets). However, if the pre-market is up while Asia is down, you may want to hold off and watch to see what happens.\r\n\r\n### Company News\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3922\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3922\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Company News](/posts/6-Company-News.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3922\">[bloomua](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-84217639/stock-photo-man-hands-are-pointing-on-touch-screen-device-with-business-news.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is almost like insider trading – but legal. Watch company news. When you stay on top of recent developments you can be the first to buy or sell based on these developments. Most traders will not jump on the bandwagon for an hour or more. You need to move quickly, but if the news is good or bad, you can adjust your investment accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Gauge and Move\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3923\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3923\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Gauge and Move](/posts/7-Gauge-and-Move.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3923\">[imageflow](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-197241950/stock-photo-businessman-and-the-choice-sell-or-buy.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTo make money on the stock market and to really outsmart the system, you need to gauge and move quickly. You can’t drag your feet on this. Quickly analyze what is going on, look at the market and make your move.\r\n\r\n### China Small Cap Stocks\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3924\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3924\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 China Small Cap Stocks](/posts/8-China-Small-Cap-Stocks.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3924\">[creativa_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-313852031/stock-photo-young-male-broker-looking-at-a-stock-market-of-china-with-declining-arrows.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to keep your investments within the United States to make your money. China has been a booming economy for some time now and it makes it possible to really make money quickly. With small cap stocks in China, you can pick up strong performing stocks that have a fast turn around value. With the continued stimulus pumping into the economy out of Beijing, you’ll see a nice return on investment quickly.\r\n\r\n### Look Toward Russia\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3925\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3925\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Look Toward Russia](/posts/9-Look-Toward-Russia.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3925\">[william_potter](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-362748470/stock-photo-national-flag-of-russia-with-a-large-display-of-daily-stock-market-price-and-quotations-during.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nRussia is one of the most overlooked investment opportunities on the market and it is why those in the know can turn to it to make sizable gains. The ruble hit a record low against the U.S. dollar at the end of 2014, but it has been performing exceptionally well as of late (after hitting rock bottom many economies turn around and become promising investments).\r\n\r\n### Save for Risks\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3926\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3926\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Save for Risks](/posts/10-Save-for-Risks.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3926\">[almagami](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-95990590/stock-photo-risk-profit-and-loss-crossword.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe true way to make a large sum of money off of the market is to invest in risk. The higher the risk the higher the reward. However, a single risk that pays off can make up for a dozen failed risks. Instead of just dumping all your money into safe stocks (you should have safe investments to fall back on), have some cash saved away for that risk investment that could potentially pay off big.\r\n\r\n### Rebalance and Invest\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3927\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3927\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11 Rebalance and Invest](/posts/11-Rebalance-and-Invest.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3927\">[Andrey_popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-232326388/stock-photo-midsection-of-businessman-protecting-justice-scale-with-coins-at-table.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nShift money around and rebalance your portfolio. Move money out of dying stocks that are not performing so when everything is balanced again you have money to move into those risks or other investments. Never just sit on your hands with poor performing stocks. To outsmart the system you need to set yourself up right.\r\n\r\n### Sometimes Long Term is Best\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3928\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3928\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![12 Sometimes Long Term is Best](/posts/12-Sometimes-Long-Term-is-Best.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3928\">[nonwarit](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-334223177/stock-photo-businessman-analyzing-investment-charts-accounting.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou can still outsmart the system with a long term option. Consider the long term business bond investments. These bonds come from companies that can pay higher rates than a federal bond. Go with one from a company that has a solid background so there is a greater chance it will be around by the time you are to collect.\r\n\r\n### Avoid the Herd\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3929\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3929\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![13 Avoid the Herd](/posts/13-Avoid-the-Herd.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3929\">[Nicholas_piccillo](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-24843448/stock-photo-breaking-away-from-the-pack-vector-silhouettes-of-runners-raster-version.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMost buyers flock together. The problem here is they often are just buying because everyone else is buying. Ever heard the saying “you’re either a sheep or a shark?” Don’t be a sheep.\r\n\r\n### Cut Emotions\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3930\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3930\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![14 Cut Emotions](/posts/14-Cut-Emotions.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3930\">[uber_images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-339364181/stock-photo-serious-business-man-working-on-documents-looking-concentrated-with-briefcase-and-phone-on-the-table.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEmotional investing is probably the worst things you can do and the professionals out there will tell you always avoid using emotion during a trade. It will likely backfire.\r\n\r\n### Monitor Everything\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3931\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3931\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![15 Monitor Everything](/posts/15-Monitor-Everything.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3931\">[SFIO_CRACHO](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-397577515/stock-photo-closeup-photo-of-stylish-bearded-banker-wearing-glasses-and-looking-city-double-exposure.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDon’t just monitor your own stocks. Monitor the international markets, stay on top of closings and openings, and don’t go against your guy. Going against your gut will end up costing you more often than not.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n### Leave the Can\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3902\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3902\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![1 Leave the Can](/posts/1-Leave-the-Can.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3902\">[withGod](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-81402448/stock-photo-moscow-may-unidentified-air-hostess-of-aeroflot-serves-drinks-out-on-board-from-irkutsk-to.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nHere the first of many good perks. If you are like most people, you’re probably just a little bit disappointed when all you receive is a half-cup of soda. Unless you bring your own bottle or refreshment onboard with you, these four ounces of liquid isn’t going to last, and pacing yourself with a handful of peanuts and a third of a can of Coke just doesn’t seem to cut it. Well, while you should still pace yourself so you’re not up using the restroom every hour, ask the flight attendant for the full can. Most of the time this isn’t a big deal. Unless the plane is running extremely low on a particular item, they will more than likely hand over the full can.\r\n\r\n### Tour the Cockpit\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3903\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3903\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 Tour the Cockpit](/posts/2-Tour-the-Cockpit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3903\">[Mikko_Ryynanen](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-282061499/stock-photo-jet-aircraft-cockpit.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEver wanted to tour the cockpit? If you are curious, or if you have kids, this really is a great chance to see where the magic happens. You may have heard somewhere along the line you can’t take this tour any longer. This actually is not true, it just depends on timing. Yes, you can’t go into the cockpit while in flight. However, if you ask the crew for a tour after the flight, they may show it off to you (again, having some wee little ones with you always helps). If the crew doesn’t need to turn around right away for another flight, there’s a good chance you will be inside the cockpit in no time.\r\n\r\n### Hot Chocolate\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3904\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3904\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 hot chocolate](/wp-content/up%0Aloads/2016/08/3-hot-chocolate.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3904\">[shebeko](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-118757212/stock-photo-hot-chocolate-with-marshmallows.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis isn’t something they often say is available when offering hot beverages, but almost all airlines have hot chocolate available. Maybe you’re cold and don’t feel like all the caffeine. Perhaps you have kids and you want to give them a nice perk for being good on the flight. Whatever the reason is, ask the flight attendant for some hot chocolate. There often is nothing better than sipping on a nice cup of hot chocolate.\r\n\r\n### Extra Snacks\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3905\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3905\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Extra Snacks](/posts/4-Extra-Snacks.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3905\">[miriam88](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-337023248/stock-photo-junk-food-in-the-street.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMaybe you have a second flight to catch and not enough time to stop off for a sandwich in the airport. Or perhaps you’re just really, really hungry. Ask for some extra snacks. That second bag of peanuts might not seem like much, but it really can help hold you over (especially if you have that full can of Sprint at your side).\r\n\r\n### Airport Lounge\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3906\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3906\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 Airport Lounge](/posts/5-Airport-Lounge.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3906\">[sorbis](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-258588446/stock-photo-dubai-uae-april-airport-interior-dubai-international-airport-is-a-major-international.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is something you need to check on, but it can make sitting around the airport before your flight so much more comfortable. You may even want to arrive early. Many credit cards now have deals with specific airlines, so if you’re flying with the airline and have the accepted credit card on hand, you can enter the lounge. Domestic lounges have snacks, free Internet and much better seating, while larger city lounges may include showers and individual rooms. American Express even has specific AMEX lounges around the world in international terminals. So, check your credit cards and your airports to see if you are able to enter.\r\n\r\n### Junior Flyer Pin\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3907\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3907\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Junior Flyer Pin](/posts/6-Junior-Flyer-Pin.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3907\">[dvdmorris ](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-382470946/stock-photo-pilot-wings.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere was a time in the earlier days of aviation where it was an almost romanticized form of transportation. While much of that is gone (unless you’re in the super business class) there are still a few remaining perks. Ask the flight attendant if they hand out logo pins. This little pin is a fun little item for your child. Similar to the police badges some police departments give out to children, it is just gift to have.\r\n\r\n### Virgin Flyers Drink Free\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3908\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3908\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Virgin Flyers Drink Free](/posts/7-Virgin-Flyers-Drink-Free.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3908\">[Tyler_Olson](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-183747611/stock-photo-happy-businesswoman-holding-wineglass-while-looking-through-window-of-private-jet.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTrying to decide between flying Virgin Atlantic or another carrier? Here’s one thing that might push you towards Virgin. Every passenger is able to receive at least one free drink (yes, alcohol included). Longer flights, such as international flights, come with more. If you have a child under 12, they receive some rather incredible meals from a Cooking Channel host. While this is airline specific, it is a great way to stretch your legs and have a nice beverage to melt some of the time away.\r\n\r\n### Free Internet\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3909\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3909\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Free Internet](/posts/8-Free-Internet.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3909\">[GaudiLab](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-399955978/stock-photo-close-up-image-of-man-s-hands-is-holding-cell-telephone-with-blank-copy-space-screen-for-your.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBefore you take your next flight, check out Boingo Wireless. This is a major Internet service provider not only for airports but for planes as well. Many credit cards offer free Boingo accounts, and even checking out the website can bring about some major perks. Sign up for this ahead of time and you’ll be able to surf the Web without paying the crazy access fees some airlines like to charge.\r\n\r\n### Bathroom Products\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3910\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3910\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Bathroom Products](/posts/9-Bathroom-Products.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3910\">[tunedin_by_westend61](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-200808314/stock-photo-senior-passenger-sleeping-on-airplane-while-air-hostess-is-removing-glasses.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nJust realized you packed all of your bathroom essentials in the checked luggage and you really, really need a toothbrush? If you’re on an international flight ask the flight attendants. They will have everything you need, from a toothbrush to toothpaste, face wash and really everything else in between, if you need it they will have it.\r\n\r\n### Wet Wipes\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3911\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3911\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Wet Wipes](/posts/10-Wet-Wipes.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3911\">[Matej_Kastelic](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-340124870/stock-photo-interior-of-large-passengers-airplane-with-people-on-seats-and-stewardess-in-uniform-walking-the.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt might not sound like much, but the wet wipes may just be your best friend. It is hard to tell who has used the seat and tray table before you, and often times planes are simply gassed back up and turned around to be sent out immediately, so there isn’t exactly a ton of time to clean everything. Outside of general trash removal, that’s about it. Well, if you want to play it safe, ask for wet wipes. This way, you can clean off the table and rest a bit easier, without worrying you might come down with a cold before you arrive for your dream trip. Carrying your own is a nice idea whenever traveling, but the flight attendants can help you out if you don’t have any on hand.\r\n"

It may not even seem exactly shady at the time, but more out of the norm. This can include requesting you to wire money, send the money manager a blank check, request power of attorney or really anything else that just doesn’t seem right to you. Everyone has gut feelings. You need to listen to yours.\r\n\r\n### Not Registered\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3888\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3888\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 Not Registered](/posts/2-Not-Registered.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3888\">[Syda_Productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-141986974/stock-photo-bright-picture-of-man-with-crossed-fingers.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is something you should do ahead of time, but if you didn’t, make sure to see if your money manager is registered with the necessary government authorities. You can check with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and within your particular state to see if they are registered anywhere. If not, the money manager likely is just some person who is trying to pass themselves off without having the experience, education or credentials. It means it is time to move on.\r\n\r\n### Not Forthcoming\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3889\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3889\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 Not Forthcoming](/posts/3-Not-Forthcoming.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3889\">[Nomad_Soul](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-150536339/stock-photo-insubordinate-man-with-zipped-mouth.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt is your money, which means you should be able to receive all the necessary insights you want. Some people don’t really care all that much about what is going on, while others want updates on every trade performed. If your advisor is secretive and doesn’t want to go into certain details, it is time to fire them. They need to answer any question you have until you are satisfied, no matter how many questions you have. That is what you are paying them to do.\r\n\r\n### Sales Pitch\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3890\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3890\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Sales Pitch](/posts/4-Sales-Pitch.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3890\">[Joey_Chung](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-323189642/stock-photo-businessman-and-businesswoman-meeting-on-sales-pitch.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen talking with your money manager, does it seem like he or she is trying to sell you on something? If it is, it really isn’t a good look and you need to consider going somewhere else. Money managers are often paid to invest into certain fields, so they are not promoting something in your best interest, but in their own best interest. If a money manager’s interest in your money is only to net him/herself more money, you need to find a new manager.\r\n\r\n### Lack of Experience\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3891\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3891\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 Lack of Experience](/posts/5-Lack-of-Experience.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3891\">[Ioannis_Pantzi](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-84365341/stock-photo-young-handsome-man-in-black-suit-and-glasses-laughing-against-gray-textured-wall.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are some industries where people can learn on the job and a few mistakes here or there isn’t that big of a deal. However, when dealing with your money and your investments, that is not something you want a person with a lack of experience dealing with. You need them to know what they are doing and primed in the kind of financial investing you are seeking. Whether investing for a child’s college fund or for your retirement, they need to know what they are doing. If they don’t have the experience, it is time to move elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Goals are Not Aligning\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3892\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3892\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Goals are Not Aligning](/posts/6-Goals-are-Not-Aligning.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3892\">[Michael_Kowaski](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-84221587/stock-photo-disappointed-young-businesswoman-isolated-on-white.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYour money manager likely has goals for your money, as do you. The two of you need to see eye to eye. If you don’t, there is just creative differences and you need to move along. It’s not that the person is necessarily a bad money manager, but you need to be able to sit there and work with the individual. If you don’t see eye to eye, it just isn’t going to work.\r\n\r\n### Risk Explanation\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3893\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3893\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Risk Explanation](/posts/7-Risk-Explanation.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3893\">[Stephen_VanHorn](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-100931329/stock-photo-male-executive-drawing-a-risk-assessment-diagram.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWith every kind of investment there is always going to be some kind of risk. Your [financial adviser](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T023-C000-S002-knowing-when-to-fire-your-financial-adviser.html) knows it, but you probably don’t. They need to explain to you the risks of moving forward with a particular form of investment. If they don’t, it puts your own money at risk without you giving the go ahead. They should never do that and if they do, it is time to take your money and go elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Poor Compensation\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3894\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3894\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Poor Compensation](/posts/8-Poor-Compensation.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3894\">[lOve_lOve](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-318636617/stock-photo-human-hand-and-empty-wallet-broke.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen working out the fine details with your money manager, you need to learn how they are paid. Some are commission based and will receive a bonus from their company based on the amount of money it brings in. Always ask how they are paid when signing up. If you haven’t yet, you need to ask them now. You might be surprised as to how much money you’re missing out on or how much money they are taking away from you.\r\n\r\n### Hard to Get in Touch With\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3895\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3895\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Hard to Get in Touch With](/posts/9-Hard-to-Get-in-Touch-With.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3895\">[Studio_Grand_Oust](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-336126071/stock-photo-stress-at-work-concept-burnout-young-female-manager-working-in-sparse-office-environment.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYour money manager should be easy to contact. Sure, they are busy individuals which means they won’t always be able to talk for hours on end, but they should at least return your calls or emails. If they are hard to get in touch with it means they don’t have the time for you. This also means you need to find a different manager who does.\r\n\r\n### You Don’t Understand What They Say\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3896\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3896\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 You Don't Understand What They Say](/posts/10-You-Dont-Understand-What-They-Say.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3896\">[ra2studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-428235247/stock-photo-young-amateur-confused-businessman-not-understanding-why-he-is-getting-fired-concept-with-drawn.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEvery industry has a bunch of terms outsiders simply will never understand. If you walked on a film set you’d have no clue what someone was telling the grip and lighting crew without term knowledge. The same is true with financials. If you can’t understand what they are saying and they won’t speak in clear terms, it is time to fire them and move on.\r\n\r\n### Off Track\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3897\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3897\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11 Off Track](/posts/11-Off-Track.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3897\">[michaeljung](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-95039431/stock-photo-elderly-couple-having-argument-over-expense.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nA big reason why you need to fire your money manager is if you are off track financially. If these issues progress it is time to find someone who can deliver.\r\n\r\n### You Don’t Trust Them\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3898\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3898\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![12 You Don't Trust Them](/posts/12-You-Dont-Trust-Them.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3898\">[Antonio_Gulliem](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-397094602/stock-photo-front-view-of-two-angry-businesspeople-using-computers-disputing-at-workplace-and-looking-sideways.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou need to trust them. Sometimes there’s just a feeling you don’t like. It might be nothing but a gut feeling, but often times there is a reason behind it. Always go with your gut and go with someone you trust.\r\n\r\n### Change\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3899\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3899\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![13 Change](/posts/13-Change.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3899\">[Gajus](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-263748254/stock-photo-close-up-businessman-in-business-suit-showing-small-white-card-with-change-is-good-message.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nChange happens in life. Maybe you’re getting a divorce or moving away. You don’t need to stay with your current money manager. Change all the way around might be the best option for you.\r\n"

Not at all. You can completely destroy your credit score in the matter of months. In fact, if you go six-months past due on a major bill (such as a credit card or loan) your account with be “charged off.” The only thing worse to your credit score is a bankruptcy. If you have several charge offs or accounts in collection your credit score will likely be completely ruined. So no, a bad credit score can happen quickly.\r\n\r\n### Checking Credit Hurts Credit\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3868\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3868\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Andrey_popov](/posts/2-Checking-Credit-Hurts-Credit-credit-score.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3868\">[Andrey_popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-280796339/stock-photo-close-up-of-a-businessman-checking-credit-score-online-on-laptop.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is one of the more popular myths out there. You’ve probably heard the old myth of checking your credit actually hurts your credit score, so you shouldn’t do it. Fact of the matter is you can check your credit as often as you like without hurting your score. Just make sure you’re using credit scoring services and not mortgage lenders or other loan services to check your credit. Multiple financial lenders checking your credit on a constant basis will hurt your score.\r\n\r\n### You Need to be Rich to Have Good Credit\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3869\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3869\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 You Need to be Rich to Have Good Credit credit score](/posts/3-You-Need-to-be-Rich-to-Have-Good-Credit-credit-score.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3869\">[mckyartstudio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-422593414/stock-photo-multiple-scattered-american-dollar-banknotes-in-full-frame-coverage-with-corner-vignetting.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe amount of money has an outside affect on your credit score, but it doesn’t directly hurt your score. In fact, income isn’t a factor at all when it comes to your credit score. In reality, the only connection money has with your credit score is how much you are approved for on your credit cards. If you make more money you’re likely approved for a higher credit ceiling, which means it takes more money to max out your credit. This is the only real impact on your score. Paying your bills on time is what affects your credit (and paying down your loans). In terms of actual score, money has no factor.\r\n\r\n### There is One Credit Score\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3870\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3870\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 There is One Credit Score](/posts/4-There-is-One-Credit-Score.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3870\">[ribah](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-133201919/stock-photo-illustration-of-wordcloud-word-tags-of-credit-history-report.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are actually several different credit scores. This is because there are different credit scoring models, each taking different aspects of your financial history into account a bit differently. Each model has different credit scores from individual credit bureaus, so you can actually have a large number of scores. Usually these scores are similar, although one might detect problems faster or hold onto these issues longer than others.\r\n\r\n### The Credit Score You Check is the Same As Your Lender\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3871\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3871\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 The Credit Score You Check is the Same As Your Lender](/posts/5-The-Credit-Score-You-Check-is-the-Same-As-Your-Lender.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3871\">[studio_52](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-229611016/stock-photo-hard-money-lender-close-up-photo-of-successful-boss-working-with-calculator-in-the-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIt is possible, but typically it is not the case. You’ll receive a nice overview of your credit score, but the fact of the matter is monetary lenders have access to more comprehensive information, so their credit scores are likely going to be different and show more information than anything you see.\r\n\r\n### Marriage Merges Credit Scores\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3872\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3872\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Marriage Merges Credit Scores](/posts/6-Marriage-Merges-Credit-Scores.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3872\">[photographee.eu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-220991617/stock-photo-horizontal-view-of-couple-analyzing-family-bills.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhenever considering marriage, many people bring up the idea of [credit scores](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/debt/9-myths-build-better-credit-1.aspx) combining. In fact, you may have seen “credit check” television commercials showing a married couple and how one person’s poor credit rating brought down all of their finances. That is not the case at all. You still have a separate credit history and credit report. Now, if you create joint accounts what happens in the joint account will affect your score (such as a joint credit card or checking account). However, your credit won’t go up or down based on your spouse.\r\n\r\n### A Debit Card Helps Build Good Credit\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3873\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3873\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 A Debit Card Helps Build Good Credit score](/posts/7-A-Debit-Card-Helps-Build-Good-Credit-score.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3873\">[LDprod](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-159873380/stock-photo-woman-hand-with-credit-card-swipe-through-terminal-for-sale-in-restaurant.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere is a notion that a debit card will help build up your credit score, especially after bankruptcy. Sadly that does not happen. Now, some banks may require you to obtain a debit card first, monitor you and then approve you for a new credit card after going through a bankruptcy, but there is no actual impact on your credit score because there is no actual credit involved with the debit card.\r\n\r\n### Won’t Land a Job Because of Credit Score\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3874\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3874\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Won't Land a Job Because of Credit Score](/posts/8-Wont-Land-a-Job-Because-of-Credit-Score.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3874\">[Maryna_Pleshkun](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-318947294/stock-photo-business-people-accusing-their-business-partner-closeup-shot.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is another one of the major myths around your credit score. It is actually illegal for an employer to check your credit score and use it against you. Now, they can check your credit report, but this is more to see if you owe money back to previous employers or if there is anything of this nature going on. That is the basis of their credit report check, so don’t worry if your report isn’t as high as you’d like.\r\n\r\n### Close Out the Credit Card After Paying it Off\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3875\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3875\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Close Out the Credit Card After Paying it Of](/posts/9-Close-Out-the-Credit-Card-After-Paying-it-Of.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3875\">[derek_hatfield](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-177476195/stock-photo-credit-card-pieces.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nNo. Never do this. Closing a credit card will not improve your credit score. It actually hurts it. That is because you are doing away with an extended credit history. Plus, you can’t close the card off until there is zero balance, which means this is a good credit to have on file. Instead, just keep it open and have a periodic charge applied to it (like a monthly Netflix subscription or something just to keep it active).\r\n\r\n### It Takes Seven Years to Improve a Bad Score\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3877\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3877\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 It Takes Seven Years to Improve a Bad Score credit score](/posts/10-It-Takes-Seven-Years-to-Improve-a-Bad-Score-credit-score.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3877\">[Billion_photos](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-302938517/stock-photo-clock-time-women.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTrue, a bankruptcy stays on file for seven years. However, as this negative information ages, it impacts your score less and less. In fact, if you work at building your report you’ll likely have a good score by the time it goes off.\r\n\r\n### Debt is Good for Building Credit\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3878\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11 Debt is Good for Building Credit credit score](/posts/11-Debt-is-Good-for-Building-Credit-credit-score.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3878\">[dirk_erckeren](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-417570070/stock-photo-debt-free-zone-or-tax-reduction-today-relief-of-taxes-having-good-credit-financial-success-paying.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDebt is never good. The idea of debt helping you out is a major myth. You do need credit offerings to build a credit score, but you don’t need to go in debt. Paying off the balance in full every month is much better than carrying a balance.\r\n\r\n### You Get A Free Score Search Annually From AnnualCreditReport.com\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3879\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3879\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![12 You Get A Free Score Search Annually From AnnualCreditReport.com credit score](/posts/12-You-Get-A-Free-Score-Search-Annually-From-AnnualCreditReport.com-credit-score.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3879\">[npfire](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-270813506/stock-photo-credit-report-concept.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nHere’s the thing about this site.

After the recent housing bubble and mortgage crisis, banks are very hesitant to lend money to anyone who they think won’t be able to pay back their mortgage. For this reason, many banks have shut down their sub-prime lending programs, making it more difficult to find a mortgage if you have bad credit.\r\n\r\n### You’ll pay more in interest\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3847\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3847\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 You’ll pay more in interest bad credit](/posts/2-You%E2%80%99ll-pay-more-in-interest-bad-credit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3847\">[bswei](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-286038554/stock-photo-dollar-symbol-on-one-hand-and-percentage-sign-on-another-hand-with-business-concepts-doodles.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you are able to find a mortgage, then you need to be aware that you’re probably going to pay a lot more in interest. Banks have to account for their risk in these loans, and charging more interest is one way to make up for the higher default rate.\r\n\r\n### You’re going to need a bigger down payment\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3848\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3848\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 You’re going to need a bigger down payment bad credit](/posts/3-You%E2%80%99re-going-to-need-a-bigger-down-payment-bad-credit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3848\">[Maryna_Pleshkun](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-370975826/stock-photo-saving-to-buy-a-house-or-home-savings-concept-with-model-house-inside-transparent-piggy-bank.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce their risk, banks will also ask for a large down payment. Expect to pay anywhere from ten to thirty percent of the price of the home. Of course, that means that you might have to save for a lot longer period of time. Another option might be to pay for private mortgage insurance. This is a policy that pays the bank in the event that you default on the mortgage (you won’t see any of the money if this happens).\r\n\r\n### Expect to pay more in fees\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3849\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3849\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Expect to pay more in fees bad credit](/posts/4-Expect-to-pay-more-in-fees-bad-credit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3849\">[cloud7days](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-386833954/stock-photo-closeup-hands-giving-money-isolated-on-white-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBad credit means that you may have to pay more for credit counseling before taking out your mortgage. There might also be higher fees for processing the mortgage. Fortunately, this practice is being banned in many states, so it isn’t as big of a problem as it used to be.\r\n\r\n### You’ll have less purchasing power\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3850\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3850\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![less purchasing power bad credit](/posts/5-You%E2%80%99ll-have-less-purchasing-power-bad-credit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3850\">[Alexandre_Rottenberg](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-195034589/stock-photo-big-house-to-small-house.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBetween paying for PMI and dealing with a higher interest rate, you’re going to have less money to buy a house with. Because the bank will base your maximum affordable payment on your income, the interest rate and PMI could reduce your purchasing power by tens of thousands of dollars. That could mean lowering your expectations about what you can buy.\r\n\r\n### You’re going to find some bad lenders\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3851\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 You’re going to find some bad lender bad credit](/posts/6-You%E2%80%99re-going-to-find-some-bad-lender-bad-credit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3851\">[nito](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-203387788/stock-photo-man-in-suit-showing-a-signboard-with-the-different-ranges-of-the-credit-score-excellent-good.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of lenders out there that search out buyers with bad credit in order to get as much money as possible out of them. These lenders know that it can be hard to find a mortgage, and they entice buyers with promises that they can make the whole process very easy. To avoid these traps, look carefully at the terms of any loan, and carefully compare fees as you get different loan offers. Also make sure that any promises the loan officer makes to you are in writing.\r\n\r\n### It will be harder to get a realtor to work with you\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3852\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 It will be harder to get a realtor to work with you bad credit](/posts/7-It-will-be-harder-to-get-a-realtor-to-work-with-you-bad-credit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3852\">[wavebreakmedia](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-290396213/stock-photo-couple-in-meeting-with-a-financial-adviser-in-living-room.html?)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBecause of all of the hurdles that a buyer with bad credit has to go through, realtors will be hesitant to work with you. While it probably won’t be a problem in most markets to find someone to show you houses and walk you through the process of getting a mortgage, if you’re trying to buy in a very dynamic market (i.e., a place where real estate prices are rising very rapidly), then it just won’t make sense for a realtor to spend a lot of time showing you houses that you probably won’t be able to buy.\r\n\r\n### It might not be so hard to fix your credit\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3853\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3853\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 It might not be so hard to fix your credit bad credit](/posts/8-It-might-not-be-so-hard-to-fix-your-credit-bad-credit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3853\">[nito](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-267363794/stock-photo-closeup-of-a-young-man-checking-a-bill-a-budget-or-a-payroll-with-a-calculator-filtered-effect.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWith all of the negative consequences to buying a house with bad credit, many people are surprised to learn that there are ways to fix it. If your credit is bad because of mistakes you made several years ago, the easiest solution might be to just wait. Mistakes count less against your score over time, and many people who continue to pay their bills on time notice that their score increase every six months. If you have to save more money to make a down payment, then it might be a good idea to rent for just one more year before starting the application process. In the long run, you could save thousands of dollars in interest payments and qualify for a bigger amount to buy a home with.\r\n\r\n### Getting more credit after you buy will be hard\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3854\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Getting more credit after you buy will be hard bad credit](/posts/9-Getting-more-credit-after-you-buy-will-be-hard-bad-credit.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3854\">[bacho](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-351932723/stock-photo-woman-is-cutting-credit-card-or-bank-card-with-scissors-over-contract-and-other-credit-cards.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you do get a mortgage with bad credit, it’s important to know that qualifying for a credit card or other form of credit might be harder after you move in. This is because the new mortgage will count against you when potential lenders look at the total amount of debt you have. It’s important to note that mortgage debt isn’t as bad as other forms of debt, such as credit cards, but it may be harder to get a car loan or new credit card for a few months. After some time in which you pay all of your bills on time, you score should start to improve.\r\n"

This is a website you create a free account for. You can then install a browser plug-in (this is the easiest way to shop online, although you can search manually for supported stores) so whenever you visit an online store the plug-in asks if you want to activate the Ebates money back feature. Depending on the store, you can get anywhere from one percent to often more than 15 percent. The plug-in does all the work and all you need to do is shop. There are no minimum purchases or anything like that. The money goes into an account on Ebates where you can request either a PayPal transfer or a check mailed to your house.\r\n\r\n### Credit Cards\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3779\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3779\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 credit card get paid](/posts/2-credit-card-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3779\">[andreser](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-150264458/stock-photo-happy-couple-shopping-and-making-payment-with-a-credit-card.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of credit cards out there with reward options. These cash back rewards may give you a percentage point on certain items you buy (or everything you buy). Check your credit card to see what kind of rewards you can receive, or check for the right credit card for your credit rating (and what you normally purchase). When you combine the money back percentage with what Ebates offers, you are often going to be receiving 10 percent cash back or more on everything you buy for now on.\r\n\r\n### Referral Programs\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3780\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3780\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 referral program get paid](/posts/3-referral-program-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3780\">[michail_petrov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-310240760/stock-photo--hand-writing-referral-program-with-red-marker-isolated-on-white-background-business-technology.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMany websites and stores have referral programs. Through these referral programs you send someone a link, and when they make a purchase you earn money. If you like something you purchased you can post it to your social media or email it to people. Whatever you decide to do, this is a nice way to share the word of what you like to purchase while also receiving money in return from it.\r\n\r\n### Survey Websites\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3781\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3781\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 survey get paid](/posts/4-survey-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3781\">[baranq](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-176125589/stock-photo-male-student-taking-some-notes.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSurvey websites offer a few different money making options. Sites such as TreasureTrooper.com and CashCrate.com make it possible to fill out surveys that take a few minutes and you are paid in the end. These websites also have a cash shopping feature. The cash shopping works much in the same way as Ebates. However, these services usually don’t have a plug-in, which means you need to search the database of available websites to see if where you want to shop is supported. Ebates will have a larger number of available websites, but if you are already making money through the surveys, you can always check out the cash shopping.\r\n\r\n### Reward Programs\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3788\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3788\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 reward program get paid](/posts/5-reward-program-get-paid-1.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3788\">[phushutter](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-327879236/stock-photo-loyalty-program-word-write-on-white-background-by-woman-hand-holding-highlighter-pen.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf a website you shop with has a [reward program](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/cash-back-sites/), make sure to sign up. This gives you points for everything you purchase, giving you money back eventually. While not every website has it, there are plenty that do. Best Buy has a rewards points program, as does DSW, Nordstrom, Expedia and many other sites. Unless you never make purchases through a particular website this might be an excellent option for you to check out.\r\n\r\n### GrouponSnap\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3783\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3783\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 groupsnap get paid](/posts/6-groupsnap-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3783\">[gunner_pippel](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-56810611/stock-photo-travel-concept-with-hotel-key-and-tag-or-label.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nGroupon provides money saving deals online for everything from food to hotels, flights and other forms of transportation. It is a great place to shop and save money. GrouponSnap is a mobile application from the service where you take a picture of your grocery receipt. The application then scans it over to see if there are any discounts on what you purchased. If there are, you receive the small deposit into your create account. This is a nice application to have simply to check your grocery shopping and possibly earn some money back on the side.\r\n\r\n### Receipt Hog\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3784\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3784\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 receipt hog get paid](/posts/7-receipt-hog-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3784\">[andrey_popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244879999/stock-photo-pile-of-generic-shopping-receipts-with-costs.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nReceipt Hog is another free application that works in a similar manor to Groupon. The good thing here is there is no limit on the number of shopping receipt applications you can use, so you may actually receive cash back from both services. Nothing like being paid multiple times over for making the same purchase.\r\n\r\n### Swagbucks\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3785\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3785\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 swag bucks get paid](/posts/8-swag-bucks-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3785\">[Jakub_Grygier](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-327209306/stock-photo-perk-word-crowd-from-above.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSwagbucks is the search engine you want to check out if you are interested in making money online. The search engine uses Google as its search engine only with its Swagbucks plug-in features over top. Whenever you make searches through the search engine you receive what is called “swag bucks,” which you can trade in for gift cards, discount tickets and other perks. Swagbucks has other features, including video playback where you are awarded swag bucks for watching videos. You can also receive swag bucks for shopping through its shopping service. This works similar to Ebates and the survey shopping websites. If you like the features of Swagbucks and want to find a way to increase your payout, this might be the option for you.\r\n\r\n### BeFrugal\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3786\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3786\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 befrugal get paid](/posts/9-befrugal-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3786\">[aastock](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-187213064/stock-photo-coins-in-savings-jar-full-of-money.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBeFrugal is an excellent way you can earn up to 30 percent cash back while shopping online. There are over 4,000 stores registered with the online service and you can receive payments through PayPal or a gift card once you hit $25 in your account. You may be surprised just how quickly you can make it to this amount, especially if you start to make most of your purchases online. Outside of a handful of items, it is possible to buy nearly everything online. If free shipping is included, you might as well buy online so you can receive this nice cash back bonus. Just note that you are only able to use one service, like Ebates or BeFrugal (you can’t use them both on the same purchase). However, you will receive cash back rewards when using a cash back rewards credit card through the buying services.\r\n"

So when looking an your investment, don’t get hung up on movements of the day. You can drive yourself crazy when everything might even out tomorrow.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Get Distracted by Macroeconomics\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3742\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3742\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 distraction investment](/posts/2-distraction-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3742\">[ra2studio](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-193226693/stock-photo-young-businessman-sitting-in-office-chair-in-front-of-a-blackboard-with-sketched-charts-and-signs.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMacroeconomics forecasts often stretch way out in the future. Here is the thing about these forecasts: it is often wrong. So much can change between point A and point Z that you shouldn’t worry. It is hard enough to give a 10 day weather forecast and some people try to say how trillion dollar economies are going to move in eight months. Remember when people said several years ago gas was forecasting to be $8 a gallon by this time? Don’t get distracted\r\n\r\n### Don’t Focus on One Industry\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3743\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3743\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 Don't Focus on One Industry investment](/posts/3-Dont-Focus-on-One-Industry-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3743\">[andrey_popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-363342935/stock-photo-young-financial-analysts-using-computers-at-desk-in-office.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n[Diversify](https://www.investmentnews.com/article/20160302/FREE/303029999/warren-buffetts-investing-dos-and-donts) is the name of the game in 2016, the same as it has been for a while.

There might be some basic instructions, but if it is how to strike it rich quick, it isn’t going to work reliably. If anyone could follow the formula and make large amounts of money, everyone would.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Be Short on Cash\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3745\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3745\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 Short on Cash investment](/posts/5-Short-on-Cash-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3745\">[isak55](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-76098664/stock-photo-dollars.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDon’t invest all your cash. Always have some available. You never know when opportunity knocks, and you don’t want to be left empty-handed. So, always have some investment cash available.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Bet Against the U.S.\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3746\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3746\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Don't Bet Against the U.S. investment](/posts/6-Dont-Bet-Against-the-U.S.-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3746\">[dizain](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-42105244/stock-photo-the-stars-and-stripes-with-dollar-bills-of-the-usa-flag.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe United States, even when it is down, has one of the strongest economies in the world. With so many different industries and sectors, you shouldn’t bet against the U.S. If you do, you run the risk of missing out on the investment. This doesn’t mean you can’t invest in other nations and opportunities found around the world. That is different. Just don’t bet your money that the U.S. will fail. There are so many safeguards in place it isn’t something that will happen financially for long term.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Beat Yourself Up\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3747\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3747\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Don't Beat Yourself Up investment](/posts/7-Dont-Beat-Yourself-Up-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3747\">[artfamily](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-151741280/stock-photo-small-man-on-the-shoulder-screaming-to-the-ear-of-big-man.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEveryone makes investment mistakes. It is part of the investment game. So, should you miss out on a major investment or maybe you sold too soon, don’t sweat it. If you dwell on a mistake you’ll never be able to move forward.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Interfere\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3748\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3748\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Don't Interfere investment](/posts/8-Dont-Interfere-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3748\">[stokkete](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-290693624/stock-photo-business-professionals-working-together-at-office-desk-hands-close-up-pointing-out-financial-data.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you are using a portfolio manager or someone else to invest your money, don’t interfere. You can ask about strategies and what they are doing with your money, which is fine as it is your right. However, don’t tell them how to invest the money. A great coach knows when to let his or her players do their job.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Set Money Goals\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3749\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3749\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Don't Set Money Goals investment](/posts/9-Dont-Set-Money-Goals-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3749\">[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-332295797/stock-photo-young-man-making-a-wish-crossing-his-fingers-isolated-on-gray-wall-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDon’t set an amount of money you want to make by the end of the year. Why? Because you have no idea what the market will do as you really don’t have any control over it. Should you fall short you might start to invest sporadically towards the end of the year, costing you more money.\r\n\r\n### Don’t Get Emotional\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3750\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3750\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Don't Get Emotional investment](/posts/10-Dont-Get-Emotional-investment.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3750\">[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-212692168/stock-photo-young-businessman-meditating-eyes-closed-isolated-grey-wall-background-stress-relief-techniques.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEmotional investment is not a good idea at all.

Kansas City has a metro population of over 1.5 million and a median income with at least a bachelor’s degree of nearly $51,000. Rent is lower than other locations at $850. To make money you’ll likely need a job at first, and the unemployment rate for those with a bachelor’s degree is 2.4 percent. With access to infrastructure, jobs and really everything you might need, this is an excellent location to start.\r\n\r\n### Lancaster, Pennsylvania\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3728\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3728\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 Lancaster PA millionaire](/posts/2-Lancaster-PA-millionaire.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3728\">[hutch_photography](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-284194565/stock-photo-aerial-view-of-small-city-of-lancaster-pennsylvania.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSo this isn’t the mega city you’re looking for, but it does give you plenty of options. The metro population is just under 400,000 with a median income for those with at least a bachelor’s degree at $50,000. Rent is a bit higher than Kansas City at $892, although the unemployment rate of 2.3 is slightly lower. It is a good place to land a job, has quality healthcare services, and it has easy access to the New Jersey Turnpike. With the abundance of jobs without being in a massive city, this may be the right spot for you to make your millions.\r\n\r\n### Cincinnati\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3729\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3729\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 cincinnati millionaire](/posts/3-cincinnati-millionaire.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3729\">[Rudy_Balasko](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-110632499/stock-photo-cincinnati-skyline-image-of-cincinnati-and-john-a-roebling-suspension-bridge-at-twilight.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis city at the southern edge of Ohio, bleeding into northern Kentucky is an excellent location to look if you want a larger city and plenty of amenities. With a metro population of 1.6 million it is large, yet the median rent is lower at $750. Your median income with a bachelor’s degree sits at almost $51,500 and the unemployment rate is 2.5 percent. Here you’ll have access to plenty of infrastructure and transportation, if that’s what you need, so you’ll have basically everything covered on your question of becoming a millionaire.\r\n\r\n### Ogden, Utah\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3730\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3730\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 ogden millionaire](/posts/4-ogden-millionaire.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3730\">[PureRadiancePhoto](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-290334998/stock-photo-mount-ogden-peak-in-mountain-green-utah.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe metro area here is larger than you think, with a population around 575,000.

The rent is a bit higher at $860 and the median income is $47,000, although the unemployment rate for those with a bachelor’s degree is 2.1 percent. It is just two hours from Philadelphia, so if you need to move your operation to a larger city it is available. You don’t need a mega city in order to become a millionaire, you just need what gives you ample opportunity, has the resources you need and feels right. Harrisburg might just be the answer for you.\r\n\r\n### Cedar Rapids, Iowa\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3732\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3732\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 cedar rapids millionaire](/posts/6-cedar-rapids-millionaire.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3732\">[wisit_wongba](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-324475643/stock-photo-cedar-rapids-at-dawn.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is the second smallest city on the list, but it also has some major perks. At 177,000 metro population there is enough around for you to get what you need down without feeling cramped. You actually have to try to not get work here, as the unemployment rate for those with a bachelor’s degree is just 0.3 percent with an average salary of nearly $51,000. Plus, the median rent is lower at just over $700. All of this makes for an excellent location to get your business or million dollar idea up and running.\r\n\r\n### Des Moines, Iowa\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3733\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3733\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 des moines millionaire](/posts/7-des-moines-millionaire.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3733\">[Mindy_Bockewitz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-430634341/stock-photo-des-moines-iowa-skyline-taken-from-the-bike-path-next-to-the-des-moines-river-in-autumn.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nLove Iowa, but need something just a little bit bigger? Des Moines might be the answer for you at 476,000 in the metro area. The unemployment rate for those with a bachelor’s degree sits at only 1.3 percent with the median income at an excellent $56,000. Rent is higher at $825, so keep that in mind. You will have access to everything you might need here, a great work force for your business and one of the best financial markets in the country.\r\n\r\n### Shreveport, Louisiana\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3734\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3734\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 shreveport millionaire](/posts/8-shreveport-millionaire.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3734\">[Katherine_Welles](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-194776925/stock-photo-shreveport-la-march-the-waterfront-area-located-in-shreveport-louisiana-on-march.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSo, maybe you’d rather have a bit more warmth in the city where you become a millionaire? If so, Shreveport, Louisiana might be the option for you. It is one of the smallest metro areas on this list at just under 300,000, but it also has one of the lower unemployment rates for those with a bachelor’s degree at 2.2 percent.

So, while you work on your own idea or business, you’ll earn a good amount along the way. Rent is at $840, but with the higher income that shouldn’t be a problem.\r\n\r\n### Springfield, Illinois\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3735\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3735\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 springfield millionaire](/posts/9-springfield-millionaire.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3735\">[Susan_Santa_Maria](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-199956752/stock-photo-old-state-capitol-of-illinois-in-springfield.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf Abraham Lincoln can do it, you should have some confidence, as well.

It will be easier to track and adjust the smaller payments, and you’ll save a small amount in interest since interest will not accrue on the portion of the bill you pay each week.\r\n\r\n### Use half of any “bonus” money to pay off your cards\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4026\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4026\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Use half of any “bonus” money to pay off your cards credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_77241736.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4026\">[Sergey_Mironov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-77241736/stock-photo-businessman-counts-money.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nA bonus at work, gifts, or money earned from working overtime should be used to pay off your cards. Use half of what you make to pay off debt, put a quarter in savings, and use the remaining quarter on something fun.\r\n\r\n### Start a business\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4027\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4027\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![start a business credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_51764395.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4027\">[Ingrid_Balabanova](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-51764395/stock-photo-man-laying-sod-for-new-garden-lawn.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nProviding cleaning services, landscaping, or babysitting can be a good way to earn some extra money and get your debts paid off. If the business really takes off, you may even be able to quit your job.\r\n\r\n### Pick up more work\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4028\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4028\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![pick up more work credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_428795917.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4028\">[Jacob_Lund](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-428795917/stock-photo-portrait-of-cafe-owner-wearing-a-hat-and-apron-standing-at-the-counter-and-looking-away-barista.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAsk for overtime or work as a consultant in your field.

If your bank doesn’t do this, redirect a portion of your check into a savings account that you use to pay off your credit cards.\r\n\r\n### Save all your money\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4031\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4031\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![save all your money credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_224295640.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4031\">[Andrey_Poppov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-224295640/stock-photo-piggybank-looking-at-calculator-isolated-on-white.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is a good trick for people who think they can’t save anything. Instead of depositing your paycheck into a checking account, deposit the whole thing into a savings account. Then, transfer the money you need to pay your bills into checking along with a small amount to pay for “fun” things. The rest of your paycheck will stay in savings. Having to go through the extra step of transferring more money will make it harder for you to spend everything. At the end of each month, use 10% of whatever is in your savings account to pay down your credit card.\r\n\r\n### Pay off your small debts first\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4032\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4032\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![Pay off your small debts first credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_209123032.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4032\">[Atstock_Productions](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-209123032/stock-photo-hand-receiving-money-from-businessman-united-states-dollar-usd-bills.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBy focusing on eliminating your small credit card bills, it will be easier to stay motivated to pay off your entire debt. As you pay off each card, use the money that you were spending for that card to the next largest debt.\r\n\r\n### Save your change\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4033\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4033\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![save your change credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_244678267.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4033\">[Steven_Frame](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244678267/stock-photo-man-drops-money-into-a-glass-jar-for-a-savings-account.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nEvery evening, empty your pockets of any loose change and save it all in a jar or other container. When it’s time to pay your credit card, deposit the money at your bank and use it to pay down your debt.\r\n\r\n### Try clickwork\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4034\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4034\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![clickwork credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_187469618.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4034\">[bacho](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-187469618/stock-photo-businessman-is-working-on-tablet-and-using-smart-phone-in-office-with-laptop.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of [ sites ](https://www.swagbucks.com/refer/sh81)that pay you money to perform internet searches and take surveys. Sign up for a few and “work” while you’re on break at work or watching TV at home.\r\n\r\n### Cut your cable\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4035\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4035\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![cut your cable credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_222366613.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4035\">[burlingham](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-222366613/stock-photo-cutting-cable-tv-cable.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAlso think about reducing your cell phone plan and getting rid of any other monthly subscription services. You can survive for a few months by reading books from a local library. Use the money you save to pay off the credit cards.\r\n\r\n### Get a roommate\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4036\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4036\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![get a roommate credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_331055099.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4036\">[Antonio_Guillem](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-331055099/stock-photo-happy-couple-moving-house-and-taking-measure-together-for-the-furniture.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYour housing expenses are probably your biggest bill. Sharing them with another person can help to cut down on what you’re spending. Sharing utilities will help too.\r\n\r\n### Get crazy about saving electricity\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4037\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4037\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![save electricity credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_309129578.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4037\">[Arman_Zhenikeyev](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-309129578/stock-photo-human-hand-holding-energy-saving-lamp-at-the-blackboard.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of sites with lists of ideas to cut down on electricity. Become fanatical about turning off lights and only running the dryer at night.\r\n\r\n### Get rid of your car\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4038\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4038\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![sell your car credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_223938919.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4038\">[oneinchpunch](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-223938919/stock-photo-car-sales-one-person-sells-car-and-gives-the-key-to-the-new-owner.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you live in a city, rely on public transportation and ride sharing apps. You’ll eliminate your car payment, parking fees, and insurance costs.\r\n\r\n### Have friends over for dinner\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4039\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_4039\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![have friends for dinner credit card debt](/posts/shutterstock_146199644.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4039\">[Rido](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-146199644/stock-photo-group-of-happy-young-friends-having-dinner-at-patio.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nGoing out can cost a fortune.

This will involve some careful planning; you can’t impulse buy all the ingredients you need for dinner. Instead, learn to meal plan around what you have on hand.\r\n\r\n### Use coupons from a lot of different sources\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3805\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3805\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 Use coupons from a lot of different sources groceries](/posts/2-Use-coupons-from-a-lot-of-different-sources-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3805\">[monkey business images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-284500190/stock-photo-woman-in-grocery-aisle-of-supermarket-with-coupons.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nClip them from newspapers, print them off specialty sites, and sign up for apps that let you scan your receipt when you’re done shopping.

Not buying this stuff will improve your health and knock about 20% off your grocery bill. Instead, learn a few simple recipes, and occasionally bake these things at home.\r\n\r\n### Shop early in the morning\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3807\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3807\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 Shop early in the morning groceries](/posts/4-Shop-early-in-the-morning-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3807\">[speedkingz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-258518462/stock-photo-store-owner-turning-open-sign-in-shop-doorway.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMost stores will put items that are about to expire on discount as soon as the store opens in the morning. If you get there first, you can save a lot on milk, cheese, meat, and produce. Just make sure you have a plan to eat it soon.\r\n\r\n### Slice your own produce\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3810\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3810\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 Slice your own produce groceries](/posts/5-Slice-your-own-produce-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3810\">[efired](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-280926380/stock-photo-young-woman-in-apron-slicing-ripe-watermelon-on-wooden-table-young-man-putting-watermelon-on-table.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou may want to invest in a mandolin or other automatic chopper, but you can save a lot by buying whole produce. The pre-cut stuff tends to cost two to three times as much.\r\n\r\n### Shop discount stores\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3809\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3809\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Shop discount stores groceries](/posts/6-Shop-discount-stores-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3809\">[Zurijeta](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-71606413/stock-photo-bread-factory.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDiscount grocery stores don’t offer the same amenities as a full-service store, but they are good places to pick up cheap canned goods and frozen foods. You may also want to look for a factory-outlet bread store in your area.\r\n\r\n### Carefully consider bulk purchases\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3811\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3811\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Carefully consider bulk purchases groceries](/posts/7-Carefully-consider-bulk-purchases-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3811\">[Blue_Lemon_Photo](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-274637498/stock-photo-bulk-nuts-and-fruit-in-grocery-store.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile the cost per ounce might be cheaper, it just doesn’t make sense to buy a large package if you’re going to throw most of it away. Think about how much of the product you’ll actually use, then compute the cost per serving.\r\n\r\n### Learn to make your own foods\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3812\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3812\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Learn to make your own foods groceries](/posts/8-Learn-to-make-your-own-foods-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3812\">[photographee.eu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-188730137/stock-photo-making-fruit-jams-bassed-on-traditional-recipe.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMany times, it can be cheaper to make your own salad dressings, jam, and spice mixes than it is to buy them at the store. It doesn’t take a lot of time, and it can save you a lot of money. Of course, really consider the cost of your ingredients. Occasionally, it makes sense to just buy pre-made items, especially if they’re being discounted or you have a coupon.\r\n\r\n### Stockpile with care\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3813\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3813\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 Stockpile with care groceries](/posts/9-Stockpile-with-care-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3813\">[sophie_mcauley](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-321397946/stock-photo-image-of-a-fully-stocked-store-room.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nTV shows that show people clearing shelves of ten cent mustard might be entertaining to watch, but most people don’t need to take everything a store has when they find a good deal. Only buy what you’ll use. Don’t fall into the trap of stockpiling decades-old salad dressing in your basement, just to throw it all away. If you do accidentally overbuy, donate your excess to a local food bank.\r\n\r\n### Think creatively\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3814\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3814\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Think creatively groceries](/posts/10-Think-creatively-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3814\">[klublu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-255512875/stock-photo-young-couple-cooking-man-and-woman-in-their-kitchen.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen you do find a good deal, think about how you can use a lot of that item. Can yo make a large batch of freezable soup, for example? If you have a potluck coming up, could you bring all the condiments (that you got for free by combining a sale price and a coupon) instead of cooking a dish?\r\n\r\n### Rethink your deep freezer\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3815\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3815\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11 Rethink your deep freezer groceries](/posts/11-Rethink-your-deep-freezer-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3815\">[speedkingz](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-366048545/stock-photo-woman-checking-sell-by-date-on-salad-bag-in-refrigerator.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFrugal living experts love to tell people that they need a deep freezer to store all their bargains, but consider that the cost of running that appliance is about $30 a month. If you’re not saving that much, then you need to go down to one freezer.\r\n\r\n### Cut back on meat\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3816\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3816\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![12 Cut back on meat groceries](/posts/12-Cut-back-on-meat-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3816\">[pixfly](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-298125683/stock-photo-fruit-and-vegetable-in-shopping-basket-sits-on-the-counter-in-the-supermarket.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMeat is one of the most expensive items you put into shopping cart. While you might not be enthusiastic about becoming a vegetarian, it may be a good idea to find a few meatless recipes that you like. If you drop meat from your diet one day a week, you’ll see some significant savings, and you might even feel healthier, too.\r\n\r\n### Shop at farmer’s markets\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3817\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3817\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![13 Shop at farmer’s markets groceries](/posts/13-Shop-at-farmer%E2%80%99s-markets-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3817\">[pixelbliss](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-314165417/stock-photo-farmers-market.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThese have become more trendy in some areas, causing prices to go up. If you shop at well-established markets, however, you can find some good deals. Remember to buy produce in season, and shop towards the end of the day when sellers are more desperate to get everything sold.\r\n\r\n### Consider joining a co-op\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3818\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3818\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![14 Consider joining a co-op groceries](/posts/14-Consider-joining-a-co-op-groceries.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3818\">[michaeljung](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-186841631/stock-photo-two-happy-gardeners-talking-in-greenhouse.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFood co-ops are becoming a popular way for farmers to get food directly to customers without having to go through grocery stores. Many areas have co-ops that focus on specific items, such as local produce, while others are larger operations that import large quantities of food.\r\n"

It also has an impressive following. Many people who purchase a Subaru stick with the company for future purchases. With that said, the Forester will cost the average owner over $12,000 to maintain over a 10 year period. This includes everything from regular oil changes to necessary replacements that come about with owning the vehicle.\r\n\r\n### Mazda6\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3792\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3792\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 mazda cars](/posts/2-mazda-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3792\">[VanderWolfImages](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-329048075/stock-photo-geneva-switzerland-march-mazda-shown-at-the-th-international-geneva-motor-show-in.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAs one of the more popular vehicles on the list, some might be surprised to see it here. However, it costs $12,700 to maintain over 10 years. That’s an additional $1,270 every single year to maintain the vehicle. Mazda usually does very well in terms of inexpensive vehicles to maintain, but the Mazda6 is not one of them. You will notice there are a good number of imports on this list, and that is not by accident. Repairs for imports usually is higher because of the imported parts and need for specialized technicians.\r\n\r\n### Audi A4 Quattro\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3793\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3793\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 Audi A4 Quattro cars](/posts/3-Audi-A4-Quattro-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3793\">[Yauhen_D](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-352043495/stock-photo-minsk-belarus-december-model-year-all-new-audi-a-tfsi-on-display-in-the.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe Audi just edges out the Mazda6 with a $12,800 price tag in maintenance fees over 10 years. Audi in itself is one of the most expensive auto manufacturers to maintain. High-end imports, especially European, have a large number of tech based problems that come up over time. This is what costs the most to repair and it is why the A4 Quattro makes it so high up the list.\r\n\r\n### Ram 1500\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3794\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3794\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 ram 1500 cars](/posts/4-ram-1500-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3794\">[Darren_Bode](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244856809/stock-photo-detroit-january-a-didge-ram-pickup-truck-on-display-january-th-at-the-north.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is the only truck to make it on the list. Pickup trucks, when maintained, are able to last a long time. This is because the engines, frames, transmission, and really everything about the truck is designed to tow and haul. So, everything is built to handle more extreme conditions. While the price of pickups has increased at a steady rate over the last two decades (mostly in part to adhere to government regulations requiring improved fuel economy, which in turn mandates more expensive parts to be used), you can drive it longer. The Ram 1500 however costs $13,300 over 10 years to maintain. The issue isn’t specifically with the Ram itself, but Dodge vehicles have a higher need for repairs than other vehicles sharing the same class, and so when comparing with other pickups, this is one thing to consider.\r\n\r\n### Dodge Grand Caravan\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3795\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3795\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 Dodge Grand Caravan cars](/posts/5-Dodge-Grand-Caravan-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3795\">[Ed_Aldridge](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-341468942/stock-photo-miami-beach-fl-usa-november-dodge-grand-caravan-on-display-during-the-miami.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThe Grand Caravan has been one of the most popular minivans, especially as more families shifted towards SUVs. Additionally, the Grand Caravan is likely short for this world as the Pacifica from Chrysler is coming out and will more than likely mean the end of the Grand Caravan line. Maintenance on the Grand Caravan is one of the highest of all vehicles at $14,500 over 10 years.\r\n\r\n### Chevrolet Cobalt\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3796\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3796\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 Chevrolet Cobalt cars](/posts/6-Chevrolet-Cobalt-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3796\">[miker](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-27558931/stock-photo-minneapolis-march-chevrolet-cobalt-on-display-at-the-minneapolis-international-auto.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYes, this very small vehicle is more expensive to maintain than an Audi, Ram 1500, and Grand Caravan, all of which probably cost twice as much as the Cobalt. The Cobalt, which took over for the Chevy Cavalier is no longer in production, so you should only keep this in mind if you are looking for a used vehicle. It costs over $14,500 to maintain over 10 years, which is about the sticker price of the vehicle. So why is the upkeep on this so high? Inexpensive material is used to produce a cheap car, which means wear and tear is more likely.\r\n\r\n### Mercedes Benz E350\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3797\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3797\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 Mercedes Benz E350 cars](/posts/7-Mercedes-Benz-E350-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3797\">[Don_liu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-400812850/stock-photo-geneva-march-mercedes-benz-e-e-car-on-display-at-th-international-geneva-motor-show-at.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis vehicle is going to set you back around $14,700 over a 10 year period. In fact, Mercedes itself is the second most expensive brand to maintain. So why are some of these high-end imports so high up on the list? The fact of the matter is many of these vehicles are built for people who will buy the car, own it for two to four years, and then buy a new one. Essentially, the vehicles are not built to last but instead to turn heads of wealthier individuals who can afford to trade up every few years.\r\n\r\n### Nissan Murano\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3798\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3798\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 Nissan Murano cars](/posts/8-Nissan-Murano-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3798\">[Kosarev_Alexander](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-83275219/stock-photo-moscow-russia-august-black-car-nissan-murano-at-moscow-international-exhibition-interauto.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you were told when checking out the Nissan Murano that it is one of the most expensive vehicles to maintain over a 10 year period, you might think twice about buying it. You’ll spend The same about as the E350, or $14,700 to maintain it over the next 10 years. So why is this vehicle listed higher than the Mercedes Benz? With a more expensive vehicle you expect the upkeep to be higher. You wouldn’t expect that on a Nissan. So keep this in mind if you’re shopping around.\r\n\r\n### BMW 328i\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3799\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3799\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 BMW 328i cars](/posts/9-BMW-328i-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3799\">[Foottoo](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-232604011/stock-photo-munich-germany-january-bmw-i-and-i-at-the-bmw-world-at-january-in-munich.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nBMW is the most expensive automaker to maintain over the course of 10 years. In fact, the average BMW will set you back $17,800 over a 10 year period. This particular model runs $15,600 for a 10 year period, or $1,560 a year. This is nearly a full five grand over the second most expensive auto manufacturer to maintain, which is Mercedes. So, next time you think you really want a German import, remember to consider on top of the sticker price you’re paying another third in maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n### Chrysler Sebring\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3800\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3800\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![10 Chrysler Sebring cars](/posts/10-Chrysler-Sebring-cars.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3800\">[Art_Konovalov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-323273888/stock-photo-chelyabinsk-russia-may-motor-car-chrysler-sebring-at-the-city-street.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nMaybe the Sebring is on the list because it used to be part owned by Mercedes. The Sebring is no longer manufactured, as it was replaced by the Chrysler 200 (you know, the car Eminem drove through Detroit in the two minute Super Bowl commercial a few years ago), and even the 200 is rumored to be on its way out. Regardless, if you are considering buying this vehicle, just remember it costs $17,100 to maintain over 10 years. That’s almost the sticker price of the $22,000 sedan.\r\n"

Now, you will need a Ph.D. in economics, but it is a good fall back path if you can’t find something in the private sector. With a Ph.D., you can teach at the University level, which brings about nice perks, salary, and the built-in time off.\r\n\r\n### Astronomer\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3715\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3715\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![11 astronomer low stress](/posts/11-astronomer-low-stress.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3715\">[goodmoments](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-410926780/stock-photo-young-smiling-woman-looking-skyward-through-astronomical-telescope-beautiful-girl-looking-through.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAverage Salary: $107,000\r\n\r\nIf you are a lover of the stars and learning about the galaxy, you may want to consider this. Again, you’ll need the Ph.D. for it, but with this career path your observe, research and study all sorts of astronomical areas in order to either increase general human knowledge or to assist with solving practical issues.\r\n\r\n### Geoscientist\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3716\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3716\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![12 geoscientist low stress](/posts/12-geoscientist-low-stress.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3716\">[adwo](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-369361106/stock-photo-geologist-examining-a-banded-iron-formation-pilbara-australia.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAverage Salary: $105,000\r\n\r\nThis is a career path that you only need a bachelor’s degree in. As a geoscientist, you’ll study the composition and structure of the earth.\r\n\r\n### Law Professor\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3717\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3717\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![13 law professor](/posts/13-law-professor.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3717\">[bikeriderlondon](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-120907177/stock-photo-mature-teacher-explaining-lesson-in-classroom.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAverage Salary: $126,000\r\n\r\nGenerally, the only way you’ll obtain this job is if you not only have a bachelor’s degree and a law degree, but have served as a lawyer already. Being a lawyer can be stressful. However, being a law professor is easy on the stress as you no longer have cases to worry about.\r\n\r\n### Operations Research Analyst\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3718\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3718\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![14 Operations Research Analyst low stress](/posts/14-Operations-Research-Analyst-low-stress.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3718\">[imageflow](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-300431846/stock-photo-close-up-of-the-businessman-who-points-out-the-growing-arrow-which-symbolises-the-concept-of-the.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nAverage Salary: $83,000\r\n\r\nYou will need at least a master’s degree here. With it you’ll use mathematics to investigate issues in an assortment of fields. This is an excellent career path if you enjoy analytics and mathematics. This is one of those career paths you’ll either love or stay away from if you are not strong in math.\r\n"

Caffeine can have the same affect on some people. The best way to determine whether or not these foods are causing problems is to keep a food journal. This way, you’ll know what might be causing problems and whether or not you need to avoid the kind of food in your diet.\r\n\r\n### The Right Clothing\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3655\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3655\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 clothing](/posts/2-clothing.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3655\">[angelo aldro mella](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-257475145/stock-photo-clothes-make-running-with-isotonic-drink-phone-and-t-shirt.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWearing the wrong clothing can force you to feel hotter and to sweat more. You need loose fitting clothing that allows air circulation around the skin. This keeps you feeling cooler and it also slows down moisture buildup. When you work out, you’ll need to go with a wicking fabric that pulls moisture. You may even want to toss an extra t-shirt over top if you want to cover up the sweating in the gym (although it is far more acceptable to others in the gym).\r\n\r\n### Cut the Stress\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3656\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3656\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 stress](/posts/3-stress.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3656\">[monkey business images](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-120714562/stock-photo-senior-woman-relaxing-in-hammock-with-e-book.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nStress can play all sorts of tricks on your body. One of the issues that might come up is increasing the amount you sweat. Of course, it is one of those circles that just seems impossible to get off. Stress will cause sweating, and you might feel more stressed out because of the sweating, which then causes the sweating to continue. It is frustrating, but you can try to help reduce your stress with a yoga class, self-guided meditation CD or video (check out YouTube, there are a ton) or just try to take a bit of quiet time for yourself.\r\n\r\n### Switch the Antiperspirant\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3658\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3658\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 deodorant man](/posts/4-deodorant-man.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3658\">[yuriy rudyy](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-403648402/stock-photo-portrait-of-handsome-naked-man-using-an-antiperspirant-on-a-dark-background.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDeodorants just fix the smell. Antiperspirants are used to block the sweat glands. If the current one you are using doesn’t work, switch to a different brand (you can actually test this out with the travel sizes, so you’re spending a fraction of the price to find one that works). There are “prescription strength” options available, which do cost a bit more, but take it up a notch. If these still don’t work, you may want to talk with your doctor for an actual prescription antiperspirant. Prescription options are extreme, and while you likely won’t need it, if you do it is available to you.\r\n\r\n### Mind the Feet\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3657\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3657\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4b feet](/posts/4-deodorant.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3657\">[Veles Studios](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-333217718/stock-photo-cheerful-girl-wearing-in-cap-shirt-sandals-and-shorts-with-backpack-sitting-on-the-pavement.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou will often sweat more when your feet and hands are covered (head too, although this is usually less of an issue). It is why covering your hands and feet in the winter is so important. The blood circulates closely here so if the area is warmer, the blood will be warmer and move through the rest of your body, causing an increase in body temperature. Try to find breathable shoes and socks to reduce your sweating and foot temperature. Wearing sandals and open toed shoes can help with this a good deal as well.\r\n\r\n### Run a Fan\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3659\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3659\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 fan](/posts/5-fan.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3659\">[ezzolo](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-390893965/stock-photo-i-am-very-hot-fawn-pug-dog-sleeping-in-front-green-fan-on-concrete-floor-in-very-hot-day.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nDo you find you sweat at night, waking up to a wet pillow? If so, turn on a fan. This helps increase air circulation over your body and really cool, you off. Also, consider kicking your feet out from under the covers as this can help prevent sweating while you sleep.\r\n\r\n### Cut the Unhealthy Habits\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3660\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3660\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 unhealty habits](/posts/6-unhealty-habits.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3660\">[Marc Bruxelle](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-361935386/stock-photo-quit-smoking-male-hand-crushing-cigarette.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you are a smoker or heavy drinker, it might be time to cut all of this out. These unhealthy habits may be causing you to sweat more (or at least are part of the problem). Even if this is not the issue, cutting these out of your daily routine will improve your overall health, which is a good time.\r\n\r\n### Under Arm Liners\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3661\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3661\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 under arm](/posts/7-under-arm.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3661\">[nadya lukic](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-321334751/stock-photo-young-woman-enjoying-spring-breeze-in-the-park-the-sun-is-shining.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThese liners attach to the interior of your clothing. This will block sweat from absorbing into your clothing. This will do two things. First, it prevents the sweat stains from appearing on your clothing. Second, it helps you avoid moisture constantly around your skin, which can eventually lead to several negative side effects, such as rashes, pimples and other issues in the area.\r\n\r\n### Botox\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3662\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3662\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 botox](/posts/8-botox.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3662\">[baloncici](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-246293497/stock-photo-woman-having-leg-botox-treatment-at-beauty-clinic.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThat’s right, Botox, the skin filler used to correct wrinkles temporarily can be used to block sweating. Now, this is a temporary fix and it is something you’ll need to do twice a year or so. However, if you are more concerned about specific events coming up and you want to make sure you are completely covered without having to worry about sweating, seeing a dermatologist and having Botox injections done may be the answer.\r\n\r\n### Low Level Electrical Currents\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3663\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3663\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 electric](/posts/9-electric.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3663\">[Andrey_Popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-284801894/stock-photo-young-man-lying-on-the-towel-with-electrodes-on-face.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nIf you really get down to it, there are some more extensive treatments to help prevent your body from over sweating. A low level electrical current is one option you may want to consider. You will need to visit your doctor and they will likely try you out on other options. They will first write you the prescription for the behind the counter antiperspirant. If that doesn’t work they will recommend a few other tips (most of which have been covered here). If none of that works, they may point you to this option. With it, you will basically be reducing the vibrancy of the sweat glands. Some of the glands will die off completely while others will just not make as much sweat. Your doctor can fill you in on potential ramification of this (you still need to sweat as it is an important feature your body has built in. You don’t want it completely destroyed). However, this is an option, should you find you need it.\r\n"

The headaches typically come about as you are thinking about the different issues at work. Like every other area of your body, your brain needs a break from time to time and just needs time to relax. However, when you are stressed, you likely are going a mile a minute and just don’t have the ability to stop thinking about all the work you need to take care of (or the issues causing you stress or secondhand stress in the first place). This is why headaches, and eventually migraines, are a common side effect of stress and why you need to do whatever necessary to lower (or handle) your stress levels.\r\n\r\n### Upset Stomach\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3667\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3667\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![2 stomach](/posts/2-stomach.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3667\">[Andrey_Poppov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-423939601/stock-photo-young-african-woman-lying-on-sofa-suffering-from-stomach-ache.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nStress can put all sorts of additional pressure on the stomach. There are two different reasons behind this. First, it simply causes the muscles in and around your digestive tract to tense up, which can give you the upset stomach. Additionally, when you are stressed, you may be inclined to eat poorly, including more processed carbs and sugar. This forces your stomach to work harder in order to digest the food, resulting in an upset stomach.\r\n\r\n### Elevated Blood Pressure\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3669\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3669\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![3 blood pressure](/posts/3-blood-pressure-1.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3669\">[kurhan](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-312824303/stock-photo-doctor-checking-old-man-patient-arterial-blood-pressure-health-care.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nThis is a major issue for individuals who already suffer from elevated blood pressure and other heart conditions. Anywhere from 75 to 90 percent of all adults suffer some health related side effect from stress, and most of these issues have something to do with the cardiovascular system. If you are dealing with stress at the work place make sure to maintain a healthy diet and exercise. This will at least help offset the issues with your blood pressure.\r\n\r\n### Chest Pain\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3670\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3670\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![4 chest pain](/posts/4-chest-pain.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3670\">[michael jung](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-186806123/stock-photo-young-african-american-businesswoman-having-heart-attack-or-chest-pain.html)\r\n\r\n</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nRight along with elevated blood pressure is experiencing chest pain. Your chest pain might have something to do with different elements related to your elevated stress levels. You might be experiencing acid reflex due to drinking more coffee on the job, or it may cause heart burn. You can also suffer from specific chest pains because of the stress. Whatever it is, when you already have a heart condition, or if it runs in the family, you need to do what you can to keep your stress at lower levels.\r\n\r\n### Trouble Sleeping\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3671\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3671\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![5 sleep](/posts/5-sleep.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3671\">[marco mesa Sam Wordley ](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-171835172/stock-photo-young-man-in-bed-with-eyes-opened-suffering-insomnia-and-sleep-disorder-thinking-about-his-problem.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhen your head is always spinning, thinking of everything you need to take care of at work, it is going to make it difficult to sleep. This is one of the first side effects you might experience when dealing with secondhand stress in the work place. This is also one of the side effects that can lead to other side effects.\r\n\r\n### Unable to Perform Sexually\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3672\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3672\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![6 sex](/posts/6-sex.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3672\">[Notaryes](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-137653586/stock-photo-portrait-of-unhappy-young-heterosexual-couple-in-bedroom.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nYou may start to see a decline in your sexual performance. As you likely have more on your mind, are not sleeping as much and may also have other situations occurring with your cardiovascular system, it can bring down your sexual performance. This is one of the more common side effects you may start to see develop. This is a condition that, while more likely to affect men, can affect both men and women.\r\n\r\n### Mood Changes\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3673\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3673\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![7 mood](/posts/7-mood.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3673\">[Patrick Foto ](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-236806720/stock-photo-asian-family-changing-mood.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nWhile secondhand stress in the work place can affect your physical health, it also has an impact on your emotional and mental health as well. As stress continues to pile up, you will begin to see more and more of these mood symptoms develop. Anxiety has a common connection with stress. You may also feel restless, which leads to your problem sleeping. From here, though, you can start to develop a lack of focus, become quick to anger and even feel overwhelmed. All of these mood issues can push you into sadness or even depression. This is why, whenever you begin to feel stress, or show early signs of stress, you do what you can to reduce these stress levels. It might mean you need to move on to a different job, or simply take up a gym membership to burn off the stress. Whatever you need to do to reduce your stress levels, make sure you do it.\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3674\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3674\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![8 behavior change](/posts/8-behavior-change.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3674\">[chaoss](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-97104149/stock-photo-young-woman-looking-on-plate-with-rich-meat-menu.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nSecondhand stress can have other impacts on your overall health through behavior. Now, some changes in your behavior may not lead to health risks while others might cause a significant increase in health risks. One major change, depending on you and your personality is either overeating or under eating. Some people don’t feel like eating when they are stressed, others consume far more. For those who eat more, it often is unhealthy food, which leads to an increase in heart conditions and other cardiovascular issues. Drug and alcohol abuse, including tobacco use, often increase as well. While alcohol use in moderation may not affect your health, drug use often can, and any kind of tobacco use will see an impact on your health. Plus, many who suffer from secondhand, work related stress may exercise less and withdraw from social events because they simply are not into it.\r\n\r\n### Fatigue\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3675\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3675\" style=\"width: 700px\">\r\n\r\n![9 fatigue](/posts/9-fatigue.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3675\">[stokkete](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-358435634/stock-photo-sleepy-exhausted-woman-working-at-office-desk-with-her-laptop-her-eyes-are-closing-and-she-is.html)</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\nFatigue is a direct side effect from secondhand stress at the job. Fatigue can some on from all sorts of different areas. First, you might feel drained because you are not sleeping as much as normally. You may also experience fatigue because you are not eating as much and you just don’t have the necessary calorie intake to get you through the day. There are many associative causes behind fatigue, but most of these causes are directly connected to the secondhand stress you experience at work.\r\n"

It’s inevitable and for many of us it’s difficult to predict when it will happen. It can be related to a particular assignment, your boss, or it can come with the territory. Without a doubt, some positions have a higher level of stress than others. What are the most stressful jobs and why? Are they bad for your health?\r\n\r\nCareerCast ranked many jobs using a list of stress factors. They looked at the typical demands imposed on these positions and what type of crisis they may expect to be put under. They determined the following factors evokes stress: physical demands, hazards, life of another at risk, your life at risk, growth potential, deadlines, travel, being in the public eye, competitiveness, environmental conditions, and meeting with the public. Jobs were rated by these 11 factors and ranked accordingly with a score of 0-15 (some were 0-5). The following are CarrerCast’s top list (those with “Stress Level” scores) of the most stressful jobs in addition to other high stress positions that we added.

Working parents don’t get additional compensation for being a parent. Often, there isn’t a clear division between the time spent parenting and the time working at their job. Something will have to give since the balance is difficult to achieve. Emotions, stress, and guilt are the by-products of this conflict. Conflicts arise on a daily basis – attending to a child’s needs may conflict with the parents’ work schedule or deadline. Being a single parent only heightens the stress level. Imagine being a working parent and also holding down one of the jobs on the following pages.\r\n\r\n### Enlisted military personnel\r\n\r\n![military jobs stressful jobs](/posts/military-jobs-stressful-jobs.jpg)**Stress score**: 84.78  \r\n**Median Annual Salary**: $28,840  \r\nEnlisted military personnel have a high likelihood of being deployed to a foreign country and go into battle against enemy forces.

This is due to the rapid growth of smartphone technology in the banking sector that enables customers to make deposits and other transactions using their mobile phones. Customers can now complete their transactions, manage their accounts, and perform banking research using a mobile device. Most banks have mobile banking infrastructure in place that includes apps to locate ATM’s and branches, allow a customer to deposit a check into their bank account from their smartphone, and bill payment. Since banking customers are not visiting their branch as often, especially millennials, it’s no wonder when a consumer walks through their local branch, the banker or teller is primed and ready to “cross-sell” you a new product or service.\r\n\r\nPersonal bankers can honestly help their customers, if assistance is needed. They are very knowledgeable about the products and services being offered, and can answer many questions about your account. They can help you to set up bill pay, set up an savings account for your child, apply for a new credit card with a great promo, or suggest ways to earn interest on some cash sitting in your checking account. These occasions are in sharp contrast to the time when you do not need any new services and you will only waste your time by talking with your banker.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants to believe that the help they are receiving from a personal banker is genuinely given. Don’t be mislead by a bank’s customer service feel since they are in the business to make money. **Next up: A personal banker comes clean.**\r\n\r\n### Personal Bankers Work The Lobby\r\n\r\n![personal banker greeting customer](/posts/bigstock-Handsome-man-at-entrance-heart-109069568-e1464147743393.jpg)Get ready for the cross sell when a personal banker approaches you as you walk through the door. Banking centers are becoming more like retail stores. Personal bankers have monthly sales targets, and most of their earnings rely heavily on commissions. As one personal banker explained in his blog, the personal bankers and tellers meet every morning before the branch opens. They make up a list of small talk topics to discuss with a customers such as “I like your new shoes,” “Where did you get that jacket,” “What are doing this weekend,” “Have you tried this new restaurant around the corner,” Are you going back to work or are you finished for the day.” Does this sound familiar?\r\n\r\nPersonal bankers are charged with greeting customers as they walk through the door. They’ll try to pull you out of the teller line and then ask what has brought you into the bank today. If you tell them you want to make a deposit, the personal banker will offer to help as they take you over to their desk. They’ll ask to get you some coffee or water so you will feel obligated to stay for a while. As the banker makes your deposit, they can access your full banking profile and find ways to sell you something. **Next up: Get ready for the cross-sell and what a former personal banker says.**\r\n\r\n### Personal Banker Account Review\r\n\r\n![personal banker account review](/posts/bigstock-Woman-meeting-financial-advise-64564396-e1463938376622.jpg)After getting you to sit down in their side chair, bankers will validate all your contact information to make sure its up to date. After that, they will dig deep into your account and ask questions to better understand your financial objectives. Personal bankers and tellers always read the banking information on the check you are depositing. For example, if you are paying your mortgage from an account other than the one you are making a payment to, the personal banker may ask if you have considered moving your checking account to their branch. Making a credit card payment at a branch triggers many alerts from setting up a new no fee credit card, a new card with reward points, or a card with no fee balance transfers. If you own a business, a personal banker will suggest that you open a small business account at their branch. If you have children, the banker will recommend that you open a savings account. If you have a child entering college, then sign them up for a credit card or overdraft protection. If you only have a checking account, the banker will recommend setting up a savings account.\r\n\r\nPersonal bankers and tellers earn commissions with Personal Value Credits (PVC), explained a former personal banker. Everything that is sold to a customer such as mortgages, credit cards, checking accounts, investments, and payroll services has a PVC value. For example, a checking account may be worth 20 credits. If the banker or teller makes enough credits at the end of month then they receive a commission. Did you ever notice that a bank teller may ask you to opening a new account? Their jobs depend on it. Banks often hire a mystery customer who finds out if a teller is cross-selling their banking services. How To avoid banking cross-selling: Go to an ATM or do mobile banking.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, there isn’t anything wrong when a personal banker offers their customers new products or services so long as high pressure sales tactics are not being used. When in doubt, tell your personal banker you will need to carefully consider it, but you don’t have the time right now to make a decision. **Next up: The phone call.**\r\n\r\n### Unsolicited Phone Calls\r\n\r\n![telemarketing banker](/posts/bigstock-Worried-Senior-Woman-Answering-97063835-e1463937954214.jpg)A personal banker’s duties include calling a list of customers in their branch area to see if they would be interested in coming in and discuss their bank’s latest products or promotions. Personal bankers enjoy face-to-face meetings. At times they may use an unrelated customer service angle to accomplish this, and then start cross-selling once you arrive at the branch. For example, a personal banker may call a customer who has a current mortgage and invite them to come in for a review. The underlying objective maybe to sell them a new checking or savings account. The banker used the mortgage as bait to get you in since most people will not ignore a call from their mortgage lender.\r\n\r\nDon’t be misled by thinking that any call from your banker is urgent. You can easily [set up text or email alerts](/hidden-banking-tips-that-can-save-you-money) for your checking or credit card accounts. If your banker invites you to come in, just ask why. Is it an issue that only can be resolved by you coming in, such as a document that requires your signature? If not, then you should not feel pressured to visit your branch. **Next up: Meet the Tag-Team**\r\n\r\n### The Banking Tag-Team\r\n\r\n![personal banker tag team](/posts/bigstock-Modern-business-team-taking-no-14507807-e1464147265268.jpg)Your local branch team of managers, business bankers, investment bankers, personal bankers, and tellers are charged to work in tandem to persuade you to buy as many of their products as possible. For example, if a personal banker wants to speak to you about opening a savings account for your child, your account can be flagged so the next time you come in the teller can direct you to their office. Don’t feel pressured and politely say that you don’t have the time and leave. **Next up: High fee services**\r\n\r\n### Banking Products With High Fees or Commission\r\n\r\n![personal banker high fees](/posts/bigstock-hilarious-businessman-with-arm-47874866-e1463938490260.jpg)Banks sell financial investment products. Investments including mutual funds, annuities, and other products that are sold with upfront or back-end annual management fees, and commissions. The fees varies depending what type of investment is being purchasing and from whom. Don’t be forced into making a decision until you shop around and compare products. Often an investor can obtain discounts from brokerage firms such as Scottrade or E\\*TRADE. You may pay a higher fee through your bank.\r\n\r\nLet your investment banker know that you will consider their investment advice, but you are still shopping around to see what other alternatives are available before making a decision. Don’t be coerced. Stand your ground.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nThe market provides us with opportunities to make money in different ways such as trading in stocks and bonds, Forex, securities and more. Due the global nature of these markets, a lot of forces are at play at any given time. This can lead to periods of volatility and uncertainty. Because of this, some traders and brokers have devised methods of cornering the market that’s known as timing.\r\n\r\n## Emotional Thinking is a No-No\r\n\r\nTiming the market is a set of strategies used to ensure that [one profits from the market’s bullish trend](https://investorplace.com/how-to-invest/stocks/buy-trade/bull-market-strategy/#.VQwJAo6Cg8Y) and gets out of the trading platform when the market turns bearish. This is essentially about preservation and making sure to mitigate risk and capitalize on profit. The first tip if you’re looking to time the market is not to lead with emotions such as greed and fear. Emotional thinking usually leads to on-the-spur snap decisions that can cost you in the long term. For instance, following the announcement that a profitable company is about to go public, many people will be tempted by the prevailing emotion of excitement to buy company shares. You’d do best resist the temptation to go all out and purchase a large amount of stocks since things may take a turn for the worse without warning.\r\n\r\nA lot of financial experts are always looking for ways to corner the market. This could be in the form of well-written books outlining complicated formulas or simply coming up with a computer program that seeks to take out the guesswork from any investing decision. As a savvy investor, you should be wary about listening to and using largely untested methods to base your investing decisions. Take everything you read with a grain of salt, and only stick with tried and proven methods that have been used for years to turn a profit. The latest market-cornering trends should be the last thing on your mind given their inherent risk-carrying profiles.\r\n\r\n## Mix Some Realism into Your Optimism Cup\r\n\r\nEven when the market is bullish, you should think about the long-term performance of a piece of trading stock. At the same time, timing the market may put you at odds with the prevailing market sentiment, making you feel like you’re being left out of the profits. That being said, staying realistic and optimistic takes practice, so don’t beat yourself up if you don’t get the hang of it the first couple of times.\r\n\r\n## Choose Longer Trading Time Frames\r\n\r\n[Day traders are seen as a crazy bunch](https://www.investorhome.com/daytrade/profits.htm) because of their ability and courage to jump into a volatile market and make a profit. The truth is that on average, 90 percent or more of day traders lose money in the first year of trading. If you’d like to time the market efficiently, opt for longer investment time frames such as a week, or a month, or even 6 months to a year. You can fortify your patience by making sure you have a structure that you can follow on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis.\r\n\r\nBy stepping back, you’ll be able to see the bigger picture which will in turn make it more likely for you to time the market without the attendant anxiety and stress investing.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n### Sleep\r\n\r\n![lack of sleep - sleep deprivation](/posts/shutterstock_148903472-e1461001083370.jpg)Over one-third of Americans are getting less than seven hours of sleep, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). What’s the consequence of getting insufficient sleep? Studies have shown that chronic sleep deprivation results in an increased chance for obesity, heart disease, stroke, cancer, high blood pressure, immune deficiencies by missing out on needed sleep. Just cutting out one hour of sleep can take a heavy toll on an individual’s mental sharpness, energy level, mood, and ability to cope with stress.\r\n\r\n### Sleep Loss Ages Your Skin\r\n\r\n![Sleep Loss Ages Your Skin](/posts/lack-of-sleep-gives-you-wrinkles-e1461694866643.jpg)A sleep study report published by University Hospitals found a link between sleep deprivation and premature aging of the skin. The clinical trials showed that not having the proper amount of sleep is directly correlated with accelerated skin aging and reduced skin health. When you don’t get enough sleep, your body releases more cortisol, the stress hormone. When released in excessive amounts, cortisol can break down skin collagen. Collagen is a skin protein that provides elasticity, smoothness, strength, and resilience. Poor quality sleepers showed increased signs of uneven pigmentation, reduced skin elasticity, and fine lines. So get your beauty sleep!\r\n\r\n### Sleepiness Impairs Judgment\r\n\r\n![lack of sleep impairs judgment](/posts/lack-of-sleep-impairs-judgment-e1461695817478.jpg)Lack of sleep can affect a person’s ability to make sound and rational judgments. An individual may not have the ability to properly assess a situation accurately or act on them intelligently if they are sleep deprived. Lack of sleep affects how mentally alert an individual performs on an exams, negotiates a deal, or enters in to a contract. Studies show that excessive sleepiness can hurt job performance and personal relationships.\r\n\r\n### Sleep Deprivation Affects Learning and Thinking\r\n\r\n![sleepiness impairs learning](/posts/shutterstock_103114151-e1460764254869.jpg)Studies have shown that sleep plays a crucial part in learning and thinking. Not having adequate sleep critically disturbs these cognitive processes. There is a loss of alertness, attention, and concentration. Lack of sleep impairs problem solving and the ability to learn efficiently.\r\n\r\nThere are various sleep cycles that a body and mind transitions throughout the night. They each play an important cognitive role for the mind. Irregular sleep schedules or missing a full night’s sleep can result in a redistribution of these sleep stages and affect an a person’s ability to remember what was learned the prior day. Children who have a lack of sleep can lead to hyperactivity, which could impede learning. Teenagers who are drowsy from a poor night’s sleep may lose the memory capacity and focus to do well in their classes.\r\n\r\n### Sleep Loss Increases Obesity\r\n\r\n![lack of sleep increases obesity](/posts/sleepy-fat-man-e1461696289328.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs our body becomes more sleep deprived, Cortisol levels increase. When this “stress hormone” rises, so does our appetite and in turn we crave more food. Our body’s metabolism also slows down, so food can’t be burned as fast as it did before. Combining low metabolism with an increase of appetite is not healthy. Your brain also does not make healthy food choices when you are sleep deprived. Your high cortisol level seeks out comfort foods that calms you, those high carbs sweets, cakes, pies, and salty snack foods.\r\n\r\n### Sleep Deprivation Causes Accidents\r\n\r\n![sleep deprivation causes accidents](/posts/at-sleep-at-the-wheel-e1461693916924.jpg)**Highway safety**– Most people are aware of the dangers of driving while fatigued since it decreases awareness, slows down reaction time, and impairs judgment. Many people are not aware that the reaction time is just as slow for a “drowsy” driver as a “drunk” driver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated that excessive sleepiness causes 100,000 auto crashes and is responsible for over 1,500 deaths every year in the United States.\r\n\r\n**Disasters** – Fatigue was reported to be a key factor in some of the largest disasters: Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979, Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, Chernobyl nuclear plant meltdown in 1986, American Airlines Flight 1420 crash landing in 1999, and the New York Subway car crash in 2013. While the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion in 1986 was caused by a defective O-ring, the NASA managers, who had slept only two hours before arriving at work, rejected recommendations that the O-ring may not operate properly a low temperature.\r\n\r\n**At work** – Studies show that sleep deprivation can also lead to job accidents and injuries. One study showed that workers who complained about being excessively fatigued during the day had a significant amount of work-related accidents. These individuals also had more sick days per accident. The study also showed that grave yard workers’ performance and alertness was reduced, experienced poorer sleep, and had a higher accident rate as compared with day shift workers.\r\n\r\n### Lack of Sleep Causes Depression\r\n\r\n![sleepiness causes depression](/posts/shutterstock_192268697-e1460763924120.jpg)Depression affects over 20 million Americans. According to the National Sleep Foundation, depression may cause sleep problems. Also, sleep issues may cause or be a [contributing factor to depression](/important-warning-signs-that-prove-debt-is-taking-its-toll-emotionally). They seem to feed on one another. Individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorder or depression were likely to sleep less than six hours at night, according to a Sleep in America poll.\r\n\r\nInsomnia, a common sleep disorder, has a very close relationship to depression. According to a study “Epidemiology of Insomnia, Depression, and Anxiety,” individuals who have been diagnosed with insomnia have a ten fold risk of contracting depression in comparison to individuals who sleep well.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that treating depression can also help sleep problems and its symptoms, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n### Lack of Sleep Makes You Less Sharp\r\n\r\n![sleepiness makes you more forgetful](/posts/sleepiness-makes-you-more-forgetful-e1461696778689.jpg)Sleep theorists believe that sleep exists in order to process and consolidate information acquired during our waking state. French and American researchers reported that “sharp wave ripples” brain events are responsible for consolidating memory. These sharp wave ripples occur most of the time during deep sleep episodes. Consolidating memory is the process of converting stored information from short term into long term memory. Cutting short deep sleep episodes can affect long term memory, which may lead to forgetfulness.\r\n\r\n### Sleepiness Can Cause Serious Health Issues\r\n\r\n![sleep depreviation can cause medical problems](/posts/sleep-depreviation-can-cause-medical-problems.jpg)Individuals with poor sleep habits, chronic sleep loss are a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, accidental death, heart attack, irregular heart beat, or a stroke. These conditions may lead to a shortened life expectancy.\r\n\r\n### Lack of Sleep Can Affect Sex Drive\r\n\r\n![sleep deprivation affects sex driive](/posts/unhappy-couple-e1461697504866.jpg)Sleep theorists believe that sleep deprived individuals have lower libidos and a lack of interest in sex. It sounds right since when a person consistently does not get a good night’s sleep, their energy is depleted, they get sleepy at the wrong time, and they are more apt to become tense.\r\n\r\nMen in particular may have another underlying problem according to a report published in the _Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism_. The study showed that men who have been diagnosed with with sleep apnea may also have low testosterone levels. The study showed that almost one half of the men studied who suffered from severe sleep apnea also had abnormal low levels of testosterone at night.\r\n\r\n### Sleep Deprivation Can Increase Risk of Death\r\n\r\n![sleep depreviation increases risk of death](/posts/sleep-depreviation-increases-risk-of-death-e1461697721735.jpg)In the British “Whitehall II Study,” researchers found people with irregular sleep schedules or patterns have a higher death rate than those who get a proper amount of sleep on a regular basis. The research spanned 20 years and studied 10,000 people. Their findings found that individuals whose sleep was reduced from seven to five hours or less a night increased their risk of death two fold from a variety of diseases. The greatest risk of death was from cardiovascular disease.\r\n\r\nWhat are the risks of not getting enough sleep for just one night? Individuals with hypertension who do not get enough sleep for just one night can cause elevated blood pressure throughout the following day, according to a Harvard Medical School study.\r\n"

And many parents get tired of spending money on the same old toys or the hottest fads that will go out of popularity as fast as it became hot. So what are some special birthday and holiday gift ideas under $50 that can stand the test of time?\r\n\r\n![baby orphan elephant](/posts/bigstock-Baby-Elephant-Being-Fed-Milk-30020138-1024x681.jpg)\r\n\r\n### FOSTER AN ORPHAN ELEPHANT\r\n\r\nFor a $50 fee, you can foster a orphan elephant “as a gift of life” through [The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust](https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/asp/fostering.asp). “When a tiny new-born elephant is orphaned, it is often because its mother and family have been killed to serve the brutal ivory trade. For an elephant, family is all important; a calf’s very existence depends upon its mother’s milk for the first two years of life.” Remember, an elephant never forgets!

      "content": "\r\n### That Ugly Pimple\r\n\r\n![acne forehead](/posts/acne-forehead-e1461629951460.jpg)While acne occurs most commonly during teenage years, many adults get that dreaded pimple at some time in their life. It has been estimated that acne affects more than 600 million people globally. Almost 50% of people in their twenties and thirties continue to get pimples. Why does it pop up on the wrong place and at the wrong time? When a skin pore becomes clogged with dead skin or oil, a pimple is formed. What works to prevent acne and what are the best treatments to get rid of that ugly blemish? Let’s disprove many popular myths and reveal what works.\r\n\r\n### Use Toothpaste To Get Rid Of A Pimple\r\n\r\n![use toothpaste on acne](/posts/use-toothpaste-on-acne.jpg)Toothpaste has been touted as a home remedy for the occasional flare up since it can contain baking soda, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide, which are drying agents. However, toothpaste is meant for your teeth and gums, not your sensitive skin. If you have sensitive skin or are allergic to any of the other toothpaste ingredients, especially those found in colored toothpaste, your acne may get worse.\r\n\r\n### Pop A Pimple And It’s Gone\r\n\r\n![popping acne pimple](/posts/popping-acne-pimple.jpg)Popping a pimple does not make it go away faster. In fact popping may push the bacteria deeper into the skin if you can’t extract the root of the pimple. Picking spots may cause more pimples to appear near the picked areas of your skin. Popping and squeezing those unsightly spots traumatizes the skin and may cause scarring. Try dabbing a little Benzoyl Peroxide to those unsightly spots at night.\r\n\r\n### Stress And Acne Connection\r\n\r\n![stress causes acne](/posts/stress-causes-acne.jpg)The pimple that popped out right before a big exam, the night of your prom, or on your wedding day probably was not an unlucky happenstance. Studies show stress triggers an imbalance of your hormonal system. When you already have acne and you get into a stressful situation, that seems to be when your acne really flares up, according to Lisa A. Garner, a clinical professor of dermatology at the U of T Southwestern Medical Center. Another study showed that acne flare-ups became more severe during school exam times, as compared to less stressful times, such as winter or summer breaks.\r\n\r\n### Makeup Makes Acne Gets Worse\r\n\r\n![makeup causes acne](/posts/makeup-causes-acne-e1461618193717.jpg)Some cosmetic companies still manufacture their products with comedogenic ingredients, which can clog skin pores and make them more susceptible acne breakouts. Look for makeup labeled [non-comedogenic](/search-for-skin-care-and-other-personal-care-products-that-are-toxic) and fragrance-free. These products are less likely to clog pores or irritate your skin, thereby reducing bacterial buildup and oil that can may lead to inflammation and acne, according to leading dermatologists. Avoid pressed or caked products since these cosmetics often contain comedogenic ingredients.\r\n\r\nClinicians have found that some makeup ingredients may actually improve acne. Look for powder based mineral foundations since they are great to soak up oil. They typically contain silica. A light and loose dusting is better than a pressed application. Also, don’t apply too much since it may smother and clog your skin pores.\r\n\r\n### Blackheads Are Dirt\r\n\r\n![acne blackheads are dirt](/posts/blackheads-are-dirt.jpg)Blackheads are not dirt, according to dermatologists. They contain an excess amount of sebum, which also contains melanin. Once the melanin is exposed to air, it oxidizes and turns black. This type of acne lesion is distinguished from white head acne, which also contain an excess amount of sebum, but is not exposed to air.\r\n\r\n### Pimples Are Caused By Not Washing Your Face Enough\r\n\r\n![washing face too much causes acne](/posts/washing-face-too-much-causes-acne.jpg)Our natural skin oil protects our skin and keeps it supple and nice. Over washing strips your skin of these needed natural oils and your skin becomes dehydrated, according to leading dermatologists. Then your skin reacts by producing too much oil, which clogs pores and create a breading ground for acne.\r\n\r\n### Stronger Acne Medication Is More Effective\r\n\r\n![stronger acne products are better](/posts/acne-products-are-better-e1461618510210.jpg)Acne medication that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are some of the best treatments according to Emmy M. Graber, dermatologist and assistant professor at Boston University School of Medicine.\r\n\r\n- Benzoyl peroxide kills acne causing bacteria. Studies have shown products with concentrations over 2.5% higher do not necessarily increase its effectiveness. In fact, the higher concentration products may irritate the skin.\r\n- Salicylic Acid, Alpha Hydroxy Acid, or Beta Hydroxy Acid removes dead skin cells that can clog pores. It is an exfoliating agent.\r\n\r\n_This content reflects information gathered from various professionals and organizations that may offer opposing or alternative points of view.

However, it’s not just a great way to bond, it also offers many side benefits. Oxytocin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, is present during the childbirth and breastfeeding in order to increase the mother’s bond with their baby. This hormone is also known for increasing social behavior and closeness between parents, children, and couples. Scientists found that oxytocin, also known as the “trust hormone”, was released into the blood stream when you hold a friend close.\r\n\r\nHugging can also soften a person’s personality. Researchers found that someone who hugs a person they love often becomes more empathetic over time. Note: Trust is an integral part of this formula. “The positive effect only occurs, however, if the people trust each other, if the associated feelings are present mutually and if the corresponding signals are sent out. If people do not know each other, or if the hug is not desired by both parties, its effects are lost,” said Neurophysiologist Jürgen Sandkühler.\r\n\r\n### Boosts Immune System and Reduces Blood Pressure\r\n\r\n![hugging reduces illnesses and blood pressure](/posts/bigstock-Happy-team-of-doctors-showing-26892764-e1459902341951.jpg)Scientists discovered that when oxytocin is release it improves memory, reduces stress, and lowers blood pressure. Researchers further found that the more social conflicts a person experience, the risk from illness increases. Hugs, responsible for about one-third of the protective effect of “social support,” can eliminate or mitigate a person’s susceptibility to becoming sick. Furthermore, hugging can reduce the symptoms in individuals already infected with a cold.\r\n\r\nA study, published in _Psychological Science_ and conducted by psychologist Sheldon Cohen, examined the effect of social support in reducing individual’s stress. “What that means is that if stress puts you at risk for disease, then having high levels of social support seems to protect people from that risk,” said Cohen. Another study found that women had lower blood pressure following a brief encounter of warm contact with their significant other.\r\n\r\n### Relieves Anxiety and Combats Stress\r\n\r\n![hugging lowers stress](/posts/bigstock-Couple-in-hug-watching-sunrise-35553704-e1459900296649.jpg)Holding hands for 10 minutes followed by a 20 second hug lowers stress according to researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Lower stress in turn lowers a person’s blood pressure and heart rate. This makes a lot of sense since hugging has been shown to lower the production of cortisol, the stress hormone. “The gentle pressure of a hug can stimulate nerve endings under the skin that send calming messages to the brain and slow the release of cortisol,” explains Tiffany Field, Ph.D., director of the University of Miami Medical School’s Touch Research Institute. Field also noted that additional research found that getting a hug from a friend or even a professional massage can also help reduce tension.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nInvesting can provide you with valuable assets as well as a steady stream of income later in life if done right. That said, a lot of us usually wonder where we’re going to get the money to get started. We may start by looking at our already stretched budget and think that we’re about to start a losing battle. The truth is, with a bit of compromise and creativity, anyone can invest by looking into various aspects of our lives that we can trim and take advantage of.\r\n\r\n## It’s as Simple as a Garage Sale\r\n\r\n[Garage sales](https://moneysavingmom.com/2010/04/having-a-successful-garage-sale.html) are an American culture. Almost everyone I know has stuff that they don’t use anymore that’s clogging up their house in one way or the other. This could be in the form of a stereo that you replaced for a newer model, your golf clubs from your golfing days, the bunch of CD’s that you’ve bought over the years but may never listen to and the decent-looking couch that you’ve been meaning to get rid of last year. Take inventory of all the items you’d like to sell and ballpark their prices, taking care to write down everything. Hold the garage sale on a Saturday, and don’t be afraid to hold it several Saturday until everything gets sold off.\r\n\r\n## Downsize Your Life\r\n\r\nA lot of us take for granted the little things in life, especially when it comes to our daily expenditure. This could be in the form of those twice a week trips to Planet Yogurt or impulse shopping for that cute mug you saw on Etsy. All these expenditure, if added up on a yearly basis can amount to quite a bit of change. [Try tracking your spending](https://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2014/04/24/how-to-track-your-spending-and-why-you-should/) for about a week in order to identify spending patterns. Doing this will help you become mindful of where your money goes and force you to think of ways to get rid of non-essential goods and services, effectively freeing up cash for investing.\r\n\r\n## Look to Angel Investors\r\n\r\nSometimes, handouts are just as good as your own money, especially when it comes to investments that need a large amount of money upfront. Angel investors are individuals who make about $200,000 a year and have a net worth of more than $1 million who may be looking for people to help with regard to funding a startup or investment idea. These can be friends, family members or business contacts. You can up the ante and promise to pay them a certain percentage of their loan on top of repaying it. If you don’t know anyone who may be a great angel investor off the top of your head, consider advertising in your local paper, the mall’s bulletin board and other places such as online job sites.\r\n\r\nOther ways of finding money to use in investing include signing up for offers to get cash-back rewards, selling your car for a cheaper but reliable model and using the change as investment capital or taking up a weekend job. Ultimately, all these tips, if used together, will help you scrape together enough money to help you get started on your investment journey.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nJob opportunities are a dime a dozen, and it’s not uncommon for a hiring manager to get in touch with you to see if you’re interested in taking up an offer out of the blue. This could be an internal thing, or an external initiative by an organization that values your skillset and what you can bring to the table. That being said, a lot of people forget about basics such as tact and timing when it comes to accepting or declining these offers. In this post, we’ll highlight some of the ways you can gracefully and politely decline a job offer.\r\n\r\n## Extend a Word of Thanks\r\n\r\n[Hiring managers and recruiters work very hard](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-1-thing-hiring-managers-are-looking-for) when it comes to finding the right person for a job. For the most part, they do extensive research by checking out your background, professional qualifications, education and even your social media presence before coming to a conclusion on whether you are the right guy or girl for the job.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, you should extend a word of thanks and recognize their effort. This not only shows a considerate personality, it also paints you in a good light going forward. Leaving this kind of positive impression may have them calling back weeks or months later with a better suited offer or a recommendation to another company.\r\n\r\n## Explain Why You Can’t Take Up the Offer\r\n\r\nEveryone has different things that motivate them when it comes to their ideal job. Here are a few:\r\n\r\n- Money\r\n- Location\r\n- Time\r\n- Perks\r\n- Skillset and work requirements\r\n\r\nThese motivators should be what you highlight when you’re rejecting a prospective job offer. Make sure to carefully word your response and avoid being vague since this will leave the hiring manager confused. While it’s a good idea to be honest, refrain from talking about anything that paints anyone in a bad light. Be brief, clear and succinct; people will respect you more if you do this.\r\n\r\n## Stay in Touch\r\n\r\nA job seeker’s work is never done. At the end of the day, it’s all about creating relationships because you never know if you’ll need or meet that person again in the future. Consider asking them if you can recommend someone to take over the job, or ask them to pass your name and details around to anyone who may need your skillset later on. Ask to add them on formal social media sites such a LinkedIn, and ask for and hand them your and their business card.\r\n\r\nUltimately, [your tact](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ambigamy/201407/how-be-tactful), appreciation and openness will leave an indelible mark on your would-be employer, giving you a good reputation which might just open you up to future opportunities later on in your professional career. Lastly, consider all offers that come your way without rejecting one for the other since you may discover something during the interview and recruitment process that just might change your mind, landing you the job of your dreams, one that you would have overlooked had you not been flexible. Here’s to your success!\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nIt’s often said that in these modern times, there’s no such thing as job security. Any one of us can be let go of at a moment’s notice and become part of the unemployment line because of internal or external circumstances. Being unemployed can bring with it a lot of stress as well as uncertainty about the future. That being said, there are a few things you can do to make sure that you are fully prepared for any eventuality. In this post, we’ll take a look at a few practical things you can do if you find yourself heading towards the unemployment door.\r\n\r\n## Always Have and Top Up Your Emergency Fund\r\n\r\nDue to the unpredictable nature of work these days, [you should always have an emergency fund](https://manvsdebt.com/emergency-fund/) which will help cushion the fall if you suddenly find yourself out of a job. This should ideally be enough to help you pay your bills for a 6 month period. In addition, you should revise your fund every couple of months to make sure that your living estimates take into account things like inflation and rising rent prices.\r\n\r\nA great way of adding to your emergency fund is to take out a bit of cash from your shopping or non-essential part of your budget every time you feel like spending some cash and putting it in a savings account. If you’re doubtful of your willpower, consider a joint savings account with a spouse or trusted friend that can only be accessed when both parties approve access.\r\n\r\n## Look into Setting up an Extra Income Source\r\n\r\nThere’s no such thing as too much money in this economy. Every little bit counts, and this is why you should consider getting a second or third job. Better still, you can take something you’re passionate about and turn it into a career that you can do weekends, evenings or any time you find yourself free. Alternatively, you can take up freelancing on job sites such [oDesk](https://www.odesk.com/) and [Elance](https://www.elance.com/) online or opt for consulting gigs over the weekends if you have a highly sought-after skill. You might be surprised what kinds of jobs these extra jobs might open up; they just might get you your next fulltime job.\r\n\r\n## Scale Back Your Budget\r\n\r\nUnemployment usually calls for some creativity when it comes to how you’ll be able to support yourself in the coming months. If you examine your budget closely, you’ll identify a few things you can do without, leaving you with extra cash to sink into essentials such as food and utility bills. Things like cable and extra mobile minutes should be the first to go, as well as eating out at restaurants and manicures or spa visits. However, you shouldn’t have to completely forego these things if you use a bit of common sense. For instance, you can opt for eating out once a week instead of twice, and subscribing to a cheaper phone and cable plan.\r\n\r\n## A Support System Helps\r\n\r\nLastly, look to maintaining good friendships with your peers during your unemployment and let them know that you may find yourself being available in the next few weeks. They might have tips on who’s hiring as well as offer you the much-needed emotional support should you need it. These quick and easy tips should get you on the fast track towards making sure that you have a safety net in the event that you lose your job.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nInvestment advisors are a dime a dozen, and they’re not just for millionaires anymore. If you’ve always wanted to get into the money market or trade in securities or simply want to create a good financial plan for the next decade, you may need someone who may have more knowledge on how these things work. Hiring an adviser can be an undertaking fraught with risk, and not doing your homework may see you losing a lot of money. In this post, we’ll take a look at what you should keep in mind when looking to hire an investment advisor.\r\n\r\n## Be Clear About Your Goals\r\n\r\nA lot of people get into investing because they know two or three of their friends and family doing it. This kind of thinking may get you in trouble in no time because your goals may not be the same as the people you’re trying to emulate. Before approaching an adviser, [make sure you have clear and achievable goals](https://www.wellsfargo.com/financial-education/investing/achieve-financial-goals/) such as wanting to retire by the age of 55, traveling at least three times a year, an emergency fund of more than $100,000 at any given time, being able to cover your living expenses for the next 3 years, and having at least $300,000 in your children’s college fund. Having clear, written-out goals will help you stay on track as well as motivate you in a systematic manner.\r\n\r\n## Constant Communication is Vital\r\n\r\nThe average investor usually makes the mistake of thinking that the investor knows everything and that they ought to be trusted as far as investments are concerned. The truth is, not keeping a tab on your adviser can have you losing money in no time through bad financial decisions on the adviser’s part and even fraud. Make sure that the person you have entrusted keeps you on a loop every couple of days and is capable of giving you a detailed report on what they’ve been up to with your money. As a new potential client, ask them if they have records of such documentation that they wrote out for previous clients, and ask if you could speak to current or past clients. Transparency is key, and clear and regular communication will help you determine this.\r\n\r\n## Check their Registration Details and Credentials\r\n\r\nBlind faith on account of how many letters precede someone’s name shouldn’t be the route you follow if looking to hire an investment adviser. Make sure that their credentials check out by heading over to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to see if they’re registered, and also finding out whether they are registered by the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) and the NASAA, with the second one catering to brokers who are registered only in North America.\r\n\r\n## Bonus\r\n\r\nLastly, doing a simple Google search may uncover a lot of details about your would-be broker. Check out their LinkedIn profile, their Facebook and social media profiles as well as any additional information regarding their performance and complaints (if any) brought forward by previous clients. At the end of the day, doing your homework and arming yourself with information can go a long way in ensuring that your money is handled by the right people for maximum investment opportunities.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n[![electric bill](/electric-bill.jpg)](/electric-bill.jpg)\r\n\r\nOur energy consumption as a nation keeps growing almost exponentially, necessitating a hunger for energy the likes of which has never seen before in our modern times. At the same time, greenhouse gases caused by burning fossil fuel as well as setting up nuclear power plants has led to the worsening of global warming, which has in turn caused erratic weather patterns and unpredictable events all over the world. It thus makes sense to find ways which we can all chip in and reduce the amount of energy we consume on a daily basis. In this post, we’ll take a look at a few simple and practical ways that will help you cut down on your energy use as well as save you money in the long run.\r\n\r\n## Energy Vampirism is a Major Culprit\r\n\r\nPlasma and LED screens, gaming devices, DVD players, laptops and stereo systems have been shown to use up power even when they are off. This is because a lot of these electronic devices have inbuilt aspects such as a timer that need electricity to keep functioning. Before leaving the house or the living room, consider turning off the power switch at the socket to make sure everything is off. At the same time, don’t leave your computer hibernating because it still uses up electricity even when it’s on stand-by.\r\n\r\n## Install Ceiling Fans\r\n\r\nAt any given time, we usually have the AC or heater on to either cool or warm up the house. However, these devices are usually flawed because they don’t cool nor heat your average room in a uniform manner. [Installing ceiling fans](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/2479-how-to-install-a-ceiling-fan/) can help air circulate better which means that cooling devices and heaters don’t have to work so hard while doing their job. A great tip here would be to install a fan that goes either way since hot days require anticlockwise fan movement and cold days, the opposite.\r\n\r\n## Use Mother Nature to Dry Clothes\r\n\r\nDryer use happens without a second thought. That said, it’s not known by a lot of people that dryers use up a lot of electricity. A great way of getting rid of the dryer and saving money is to put up laundry lines outside and using both the wind and sun to dry your clothes. This is convenient and won’t cost you a dime, helping you save hundreds of dollars in your electric bill over a period of a year.\r\n\r\n## Oven Use\r\n\r\nWe’ve all at one time or the other gotten into the habit of opening the oven door to check if whatever we’re cooking is done. What we don’t know is that doing this brings in cold air from the outside and into the oven itself, making the oven work much harder to make sure that the ambient temperature is kept at a certain level. Resist the urge to do so, and opt to peek through the glass window instead. In addition, you may want to use [a toaster oven](https://www.homeminders.com/Articles/HomemindersArticle/tabid/77/ArticleId/520/Default.aspx) if you’re making a smaller meal since it has lower energy consumption.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, getting creative as well as using these tips can help you save on your electric bill without having to employ extraordinary measures around the home.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n“Read me a story, then I will go to sleep.” Our mother or father may not have realized that they weren’t just reading a bedtime story to calm us down so we would go to sleep. First 5 California’s Research shows 90 percent of a child’s brain develops during their first five years. This is a critical time of a child’s life. Being read to as a [child ](/4-ways-save-money-child-care)is the number one predictor of academic success. They will do better in school and in life.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that “many young mothers are not reading books to their children any more,” according to Spokane Cares.\r\n\r\nThe noted author Ray Bradbury said **“\\*\\***You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.\\*\\*”\r\n\r\n#### 30% Percent Of Children Under The Age Of 2 Have Television Sets In Their Bedroom\r\n\r\n**59 percent of children under 2 years old watch two hours of TV every day**.\r\n\r\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued a warning urging parents not to let infants and toddlers watch TV. Giving these class of viewers no known benefits, television impairs cognitive skills and wastes crucial brain development time that should be spent conversing with real people, says infant language expert Roberta Golinkoff, co-author of “Einstein Never Used Flashcards: How Our Children Really Learn—And Why They Need to Play More and Memorize Less.\r\n\r\n“Language is crucial to children’s learning, and the language they get from the television is not tailored to their individual needs. It will not answer their questions or follow their leads, which is how you create smart kids,” according to noted author Elizabeth A. Vandewater.\r\n\r\n### Some More Scary Stats\r\n\r\nSpokane Cares uncovered some very scary statistics:\r\n\r\n- 61% of low-income families have no books at all for their children in their homes.\r\n- Only 53% of preschool-age children are read to daily by a family member.\r\n- Early childhood education yields benefits up to four times the cost of the programs when the costs of special education, criminal activity, and reduced adult incomes are considered.\r\n- Millions of people cannot read a job application, a medical form, or write a check.\r\n- Education reduces the chance of being poor. More than 75% of those on welfare are illiterate.\r\n- One-fifth of high school graduates cannot read their diplomas. Many students who can’t read still graduate from high school—cutting them off from so much in their world. If you can’t read, how can you improve your circumstances?\r\n- More than 20% of American adults are functioning at the lowest literacy level—unable to read a simple story to a child. At most, these individuals can total the entry on a bank deposit slip or locate information in a short news article. But many do so with difficulty, and others can’t at all.\r\n- Nearly 3 out of 5 prison inmates are illiterate.\r\n- 85% of all juvenile offenders have reading problems.\r\n- Over 1 million children drop out of school every year. Children without some basic literacy skills by the time they enter school are more likely to drop out later.\r\n- About 50% of America’s unemployed youths are functionally illiterate—meaning they cannot carry out simple tasks like balancing a checkbook or reading drug labels.\r\n- 44 million American adults are poor readers or functionally illiterate. 21 million Americans cannot read at all. Research shows that 65% of the children of illiterate adults will themselves become illiterate adults.\r\n\r\n### What You Can Do\r\n\r\n- Take time out of your day and read to your child. This should be a priority. Also read to your child during the day when they are more alert.\r\n- Read a little slower to ensure their child could keep up with the story line and don’t stipulate how long the reading should go for. Your child should be inspired by your reading.\r\n- In 2014, First 5 California started a media campaign called “**Talk, Read, Sing**,” which encourages parents to interact with their young children to promote brain development and emotional and social growth. In addition to promoting brain and social development, the actions of talking, reading, and singing with young children help prepare them for school.\r\n- A child who is raised in a home containing at least 500 books is 36 percent more likely to graduate from high school and 19 percent more likely to graduate from college than an otherwise similar child raised in a home containing few or no books.\r\n- “**Children learn more from what we do than from what we say. Parents who love to read demonstrate to their children that reading is interesting, enjoyable, and worthwhile.**” according to noted author M.D.R. Evans\r\n"

These three super healthy foods have many benefits.\r\n\r\n**Garlic**– There have been numerous cites, dating back to ancient history, that demonstrated the use of garlic for medicinal purposes. Several studies have shown that garlic reduces the bad (LDL) cholesterol levels. The jury is still out as to whether garlic really prevents heart disease.\r\n\r\n**Lemon**– Did you ever notice that lemon peels are oily? The essential oil extracted from the lemon peel is composed of d-limonene, an antioxidant agent. d-limonene is a lipid lowering agent, which can help lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\r\n\r\n**Ginger**– has blood thinner properties that can help maintain a healthy heart by reducing blood clots and reduce cholesterol levels, according to a report published by the University of Maryland. Ginger activates an enzyme which has shown to lower cholesterol levels.\r\n\r\nCombination these three pungent, and potent foods with water creates a healthy drink that can lower cholesterol levels. Don’t worry the garlic. Combining lemon and water neutralizes the smell of garlic.\r\n\r\n## Drink Ingredients\r\n\r\n- 4 lemons with peel, preferably organic.\r\n- 4 large garlic heads\r\n- 1 small piece of ginger root approximately 1 1/4- 1 1/2 inches)\r\n- 2 quarts of filtered water\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n\r\n- Wash the lemons and cut into pieces.\r\n- Peel the garlic.\r\n- Peel the ginger.\r\n- Add lemons, ginger, and garlic in a blender. Blend mixture.\r\n- Combine mixture with 2 quarts of of water and heat, stir frequently.\r\n- Turn off the heat before the mixture boils, set aside and let it cool down.\r\n- Strain mixture through a medium strainer and fill the liquid in glass bottle(s.)\r\n\r\n## Drink\r\n\r\n- Shake bottle before drinking\r\n- Drink one glass (4 ozs.) per day before your main meal. Drink at least 2 hours before a meal or on an empty stomach.\r\n- Continue this routine for 3 weeks, then stop for 8 days. Repeat for a second period, taking 3 weeks on, 8 days off.\r\n\r\nNote: Fresh garlic may increase bleeding, so it is not recommended to anyone who is taking a blood thinner medication or who has a bleeding disorder or other medications that may have an adverse effect.\r\n\r\nThis information is intended for educational purposes only. Consult with your doctor before starting this regime.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n### Flashlight\r\n\r\nHow well do we prepare ourselves before we go out for a casual drive and then all of a sudden your car gets stuck in a blinding snow storm miles from the nearest town, or trapped in a raging wall of water coming down a hillside, or your car gets a flat and your car plunges down a ravine and you’re trapped inside? Here’s some valuable tools that should be in every car.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary flashlight will not due in case of an emergency. Having a compact and very highly efficient LED in your glove compartment, center console, on your belt, or any other convenient place near your side may save your life. Several manufactures market a flashlight with with variable setting including high, medium, low, SOS, and strobe modes. The SOS mode may used to signal a distress and alert rescuers; the strobe mode may be used to disorient an imminent threat; a zoom feature may be used to highlight or focus on a distant object. These types of flashlights cost about $50.\r\n\r\n![LED Variable Mode Flashlight](/posts/flashlight.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Car Escape Tool\r\n\r\nMany people have nightmares about getting trapped in a car with a seat belt that won’t unbuckle, a window that won’t roll down, or the fear of being stuck outside a car with a child trapped inside. No one likes to dwell on these or other scary scenarios that could occur in a car accident, but it’s important to be prepared for emergencies. Multi-purpose life-saving tools are available, such as the car window breaker and seat belt cutter. There are models that can stored in a convenient place in your car, and other models that can easily be attached to your key chain. These tools cost about $10.  \r\n![Car Window Glass Breaker and Seat Belt Cutter](/35.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"UC4-ZQoRxAA\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"392\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UC4-ZQoRxAA?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" title=\"LifeHammer & ResQMe - Automobile Escape Tools\" width=\"696\"></iframe></div>### Recycle Cell Phone\r\n\r\n![broken-phones](/broken-phones.jpg)  \r\nInstead of discarding that old cell phone or one with a cracked screen, why not keep that cell phone plugged into one of your car’s AC outlet and use it in case of an emergency? As long as your cell phone can receive a signal, the driver can make a emergency 911 call without having to subscribe to a cell phone plan. Install it in your adult child’s car or your parent’s car. Total cost: $0.\r\n\r\n### Enable Cell Phone For Voice Activated 911 Assistance\r\n\r\n![gallery_soaps-emmerdale-6615-7](/gallery_soaps-emmerdale-6615-7.jpg)\r\n\r\nMost new smartphones have a way to call 911 and summon help by just yelling at the device. This feature is very helpful if an individual gets trapped in their car and he/she can’t physically reach their phone and call for assistance. All that is needed is to set up voice activation.\r\n\r\nHave an [iphone](https://www.siriuserguide.com/setting-up-siri/)? Just go to Settings ⇒General⇒Siri. Then say “Hey Siri” and tell her to dial 911.\r\n\r\nHave a newer [Android](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6031948?hl=en)? These models have voice activation. Just say “OK Google” and now an individual can ask their phone to dial 911 or any emergency contact.\r\n\r\nTotal cost: $0\r\n\r\n**_Disclaimer: Products are provided for informational purposes only.

      "content": "\r\n### Social Security Milestones\r\n\r\n![milestone](/milestone.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Age 62 is the minimum age at which anyone can draw from their Social Security retirement account, though many sometimes confuse it with 59 1/2, which is the minimum age an individual may tap into many IRAs and retirement accounts without penalty.\r\n- Age 65, 66 or 67, depending on your birth date, is the age at which a person can claim full retirement benefit amounts.\r\n- Age 70 is the maximum age for purposes of estimating Social Security benefits.\r\n\r\n### Full Retirement\r\n\r\n![retirement](/Retirement-300x200.jpg)\r\n\r\nFull retirement age, also known as “normal retirement age” had been 65 for many years. However, beginning with people born in 1938 or later, that age gradually increases until it reaches 67 for people born after 1959. Due to so many baby boomers reaching full retirement age, as well as other financial issues plaguing our government, there have been discussions to increase the full retirement age past 67 years old.\r\n\r\n### The Las Vegas Factor\r\n\r\n![Craps](/craps-300x200.jpg)\r\n\r\nSocial Security is a safety net for many families whose spouse dies suddenly or becomes disabled. It is also the place where you apply for Medicare at the age of 65, regardless of one’s retirement age. An adult child may want to review their parents’ statements to insure its accuracy, especially if their parents are unable to do so.\r\n\r\nPage two of an individual’s Social Security statement provides taxpayers with “Your Estimated Benefits.”![Social security statement](/posts/SSA_Stmt-estimates-e1457074528862.jpg)\r\n\r\nFor this exercise, the statement may look something like this:\r\n\r\n- _At age 62, your payment would be about $880 a month._\r\n- _If work until age 66, your payment would be about $1,180 a month._\r\n- _If you work to age 70, your payment would be about $1,564 a month._\r\n\r\nThe calculations provided by SAA are estimates only and are based on elaborate calculations that include assumptions that an individual will continue to earn about the same annual income made during the last several years, and that their life expectancy will be somewhere around what they expect it to be. The current national average is about 77 years.\r\n\r\nIf an individual lives to 77 years old, we get the following total payout (“Estimated Benefits”) over the years we draw out, which does not include any interest that could be earned with that money:\r\n\r\n- _At age 62, your payment would be about $880 a month._\r\n- _If you work until age 66, your payment would be about $1,180 a month._\r\n- _If you work to age 70, your payment would be about $1,564 a month._\r\n\r\nThis isn’t a typo. Despite the rather large discrepancy in the monthly benefit estimates, if an individual lives the average lifespan, he/she may be better off retiring earlier especially if that individual thinks he/she can invest the money at a better return than Social Security estimates it will make at the Treasury-bond rate. “Actuarially, the government figures it out so it all works out the same; they’re not trying to push people to take it out early, or to take it out late,” says Michael Boone, CEO and charter financial analyst at [M.W. Boone](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/the-right-time-to-draw-social-security-benefits-2.aspx). **“There are two issues here: They’re assuming you’re average, and they’re assuming their rate of return. The question you have to ask yourself is: Are you average, and what could you actually do with the money if you got it earlier?”**\r\n\r\n### The Wellness Factor\r\n\r\n![wellness](/wellness-300x200.jpg)  \r\nHealth is an important factor to consider when considering the best time to retire. Is an individual physically active, in relatively good shape, no bad habits or life-threatening health problems to speak of? Did everyone in that person’s family live until they were into their 90’s? If so, he/she may want to wait for the larger payoff.\r\n\r\n“If you live longer than they expect, you are actually better off, all other things being equal, to wait,” says Boone. “The reason for this is you’re getting a larger dollar amount, but you’re getting it longer than they thought.”\r\n\r\nThe difference could amount to a windfall over time. If an individual lives to 90, their 20 year monthly benefit of $1,564, retiring at 70, will reap a total payout of $375,360 versus $295,680, if he/she retires at 62. (Note: A 90 year old individual receives 8 more years of retirement benefits at a reduced rate if he/she retires at 62, rather than at 70.)\r\n\r\n### The Recession Has Lasting Pain\r\n\r\n![recession](/recession-300x200.jpg)  \r\nReasons to start collecting as early as possible include: the recent financially devastating recession, historically small retirement savings (some estimates are as low as $30,000 for people 55 and older), increased taxes at certain levels, and senior lifestyles that are more active and expensive. Most people ages 66 to 70 are no longer working, and many are struggling to pay for necessities such as health care. Additionally, fixed income rates on savings are as low as they have been in 60 years with little prospects for significant change in the near future.\r\n\r\n### Calculators\r\n\r\n![Calculators](/Calculators-300x129.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) has a number of calculators available to determine an individual’s benefits. They can all be accessed through this [link](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/benefitcalculators.html). Most can be accessed without having to enter personal information, such as a social security number. Determining the best time to start collecting Social Security retirement benefits requires some planning and understanding how the system works. Here are some popular calculators:\r\n\r\n**\\*Earnings Test Calculator**– Enter a person’s birth date, estimated earnings, and other information to determine the effect on an individual’s retirement earnings\r\n\r\n[Earnings test calculator](https://ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/RTeffect.html)\r\n\r\n**\\*Retirement Age Calculator**– Enter a person’s birth date year and see how much money that individual and their spouse’s benefits will be reduced if they start taking benefits before their full retirement age.\r\n\r\n[Retirement age calculator](https://ssa.gov/planners/retire/ageincrease.html)\r\n\r\n**\\*Thinking about retiring between 62 and full retirement?** – See how much an individual’s social security will be reduced, and what are the pros and cons  \r\n[Age reduction calculator](https://ssa.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html)\r\n\r\n### Keep Working After Full Retirement\r\n\r\n![pros-and-cons-working-after-retirement1](/pros-and-cons-working-after-retirement1.jpg)  \r\nWhile there is a limit how much money a person can earn while receiving social security benefits ($15,720 this year; for every $2 over that amount earned, the government deducts $1), once an individual reaches full retirement age, this rule no longer applies and that individual can earn as much as he/she likes without any penalties. SSA will factor in any deductions and give that individual a credit.\r\n\r\n### Claim Spousal Benefits\r\n\r\n![spouse (2)](/spouse-2.jpg)  \r\nA person may be eligible to receive Social Security benefits based on their spouse’s work history <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">in addition to their own.</span>\r\n\r\nThe government will pay you your benefits first, but if the benefits that you’re entitled to through your spouse are higher, you’ll receive a combination that equals your spouse’s benefit.\r\n\r\nAs with your own benefits, the earlier you collect the less you’ll receive. The maximum you can get is up to one-half what they would be eligible for at full retirement.\r\n\r\nOne strategy for couples to maximize the benefits they receive is for the spouse who has earned a bigger Social Security payout to file for benefits and then suspend them, allowing the other spouse to claim only spousal benefits while the higher earner waits until age 70. In this scenario, the spouse collecting only a spousal benefit can leave their own Social Security untouched, racking up credits for a bigger monthly payout years later. **Note: This “file and suspend strategy” will no longer be in effect after April, 2016. The spouse who is going to file and suspend has to been born no later than May 1, 1950, and submit their request to file and suspend on or before April 29, 2016, so Social Security has time to process their application. This reflects the six-month grand-fathering window including in the 2015 Budget.**\r\n\r\n### Divorcee?\r\n\r\n![divorce](/couple_thinking.jpg)  \r\nDivorcees are eligible for similar benefits if the couple was married at least 10 years. Note that if the divorcee later remarries, he/she generally can not collect benefits on their former spouse’s record unless their later marriage ends.\r\n\r\n**_NOTE: Retirement planning and navigating through the Social Security system can be a complex business. When nearing retirement, sit down with an accountant or personal finance specialist who can help map out how to best proceed._**\r\n"

However, there is a new breed of boxers springing up throughout the country but they are in the ring to fight an opponent they can’t see: Parkinson’s disease, a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement.\r\n\r\nAbout one-million Americans are affected by Parkinson’s, for which there is no cure. In addition to pharmaceuticals, physicians have long recommended an exercise plan to patients with Parkinson’s. What’s new is a revolutionary program using professional boxing techniques to counter-punch this neurological disorder, with symptoms including tremors, stiffness, and slowed movement. A new study by the University of Indianapolis’ College of Health Sciences shows that high intensity, multi-task boxing programs such as Rock Steady Boxing can ease Parkinson’s symptoms by building neurons and increasing dopamine absorption in the brain.\r\n\r\n[Rock Steady Boxing](https://www.rocksteadyboxing.org/our-affiliates/) has over 50 centers located through the U.S. with clubs also located in Italy and others will soon open in Australia. CBS Sunday Morning highlighted the founders of Rock Steady, some of their boxers the oldest being 92, it’s techniques, and promising results.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"EfDHGbuvqiw\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"392\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EfDHGbuvqiw?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1\" title=\"Boxing program trains patients to beat Parkinson's\" width=\"696\"></iframe></div>\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n### Don’t Purchase College Textbooks Until After The Course Starts\r\n\r\n![class starts college textbooks](/posts/bigstock-Students-In-Class-Paying-Atten-3917132.jpg)  \r\nAccording to College Board, the average student in the U.S. spends $1,200 a year on college textbooks or about $5,000 for a 4-year degree. One book can cost as much as $200. According to a U.S. Prig report,struggling students are doing things to undermine their education to deal with the rising costs of college textbooks. The report highlighted that 65 percent of the students surveyed said they had decided not to purchase a textbook due to its high price. 94 percent of students who skipped buying a required text said they were concerned that doing this may hurt their grade in that class. So what can be done to help reduce the cost of textbooks?\r\n\r\nSome incoming freshmen rush to the college bookstore and purchase their textbooks before classes start. They want to be prepared. However, waiting until after their first class starts is a wiser choice for several reasons. The professor will provide the student insight as to what books are required, and what are optional. Secondly, the student may decide to drop the course after a week or so and then be strapped with the cost of the books.\r\n\r\n### Check Course Syllabus\r\n\r\n![college textbooks](/posts/bigstock-Teacher-with-Course-Requiremen-81662462-951x1024.jpg)  \r\nMost class syllabi indicate which books are required reading and which ones are just optional. The syllabus should also provide the book’s ISBN code (The International Standard Book Number), a 10 or 13 digit code which correlates to the edition of the book. You can perform a [ISBN search](https://www.isbnsearch.org/) for a particular book by using the ISBN number, title, or author and find the cost and where it can be purchased.![ISBN college textbook search](/posts/ISBN-lookup.jpg)\r\n\r\nEmail or ask the professor if an older edition of the book is acceptable. If so, what editions would be acceptable. You may find the cost for an older edition is less expensive.\r\n\r\n### Visit College Library\r\n\r\n![college textbooks in library](/posts/bigstock-people-knowledge-education-a-86349014.jpg)  \r\nFor some courses, such as literature or history, you may be able to check out some of the books from the college library. If they are available, then it’s free! Many libraries allow you to check out the book more than once.\r\n\r\n### Rent College Textbooks\r\n\r\n![rent textbooks](/posts/bigstock-Euphoric-Woman-Searching-Job-W-92315747.jpg)  \r\nMany on-line sites for college textbooks including [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/), offer textbook rentals rather than purchases. A student pays a lower price to rent than purchase the same textbook. When done, just send back the book at the end of the course. Besides saving of over 50 percent, you don’t have to hassle with re-selling your textbook at the end of your semester.\r\n\r\n### eBooks\r\n\r\n![digital textbooks](/posts/bigstock-E-learning-education-internet-89116919-1024x768.jpg)  \r\neBooks typically cost less than hard bound textbooks. Digital books may be a viable alternative if you are comfortable using an eReader (Kindle, Nook) or a laptop when reading an entire textbook or other required readings. A hidden advantage of an eBook is the ability to search for terms or phrases.\r\n\r\n### Buy Used College Textbooks\r\n\r\nIf renting a book is not a viable alternative, then consider purchasing a used textbook. Amazon (seller) and many on-line booksellers sell used textbooks as well as craigslist and your university bookstore. They often provide the condition of the books and will note if there are underlines, highlighting, or writings in the book’s margins. These are typically minor issues when saving 50% or more.\r\n\r\n### Sell College Textbooks At End Of Semester\r\n\r\n![sell college textbooks](/posts/bigstock-Student-Books-82168352-865x1024.jpg)  \r\nIf you’re sure that you don’t want to keep your books, use student-to-student sites such as text.com, Craigslist, Chegg, Amazon or other sites and sell your books. Don’t wait too long or the books may become outdated.\r\n\r\n### Occupy The Bookstore\r\n\r\nOccupy The Bookstore claims to “Save hundreds right on your school’s bookstore website.” Just install their Chrome add-on and search for the books you need. As you visit the page for each book, the extension pops up providing a list of places to buy the textbook. They do not charge any commissions or fees.\r\n\r\n### Text.com\r\n\r\n![textbooks](/posts/textbooks-1-1024x396.jpg)  \r\nText.com [student to student marketplace ](https://texts.com/)providing students with the ability to:\r\n\r\n- Buy or rent textbooks on-line directly from other students.\r\n- Sell textbooks on-line to other students. No charge for listings.\r\n- Exchange textbooks with other students on campus.\r\n- Compare every price on-line.\r\n\r\nThese avenues can save 100’s of dollars each semester. By graduation day, you could save $1,000’s and reduce your student debt.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nIt’s no wonder that cereals loaded with the most added sugar frequently come in packaging that features cartoon characters to appeal to kids. The manufacturers market to children with these iconic characters – Tony The Tiger, Cap’n Crunch, Count Chocula, Trix Rabbit, and let’s not forget Lucky Charm Leprechaun. Besides sugar, what are the other ingredients in the cereal your child (or you) are eating? Let’s look inside your child’s favorite box of cereal.\r\n\r\n#### CEREAL – WHAT’S IN IT AND HOW IS IT MADE?\r\n\r\n**Sugar**: Many childrens’ cereals are high in high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or sugar, also known as corn syrup. The general rule is that if sugar is listed on the box, it highly likely it’s HFCS. A child who eats a bowl of cereal a day for a year ends up consuming 10 pounds of sugar. (See list below)\r\n\r\n**GMOs**: Most traditional cereals contain sugar and corn made from Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) products. Note: these cereal manufacturers create GMO free cereals for distribution to foreign countries due to their strict governmental regulation.\r\n\r\n**Hydrogenated Oils**: Partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats, which are linked to auto-immune diseases, heart disease, and cancer. Fully hydrogenated oils are full of saturated fat. Note that current labeling laws permit a manufacturer to state “0 grams” of trans fat if there is less than “0.5 grams” of trans fat per serving.\r\n\r\n**BHA:** While listed as a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) additive by the FDA, BHA has been linked to cancer in some studies. The National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Toxicology Programs has concluded that it can be “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.” The FDA stated that BHA and BHT are said to be at low enough levels to be safe for human consumption.\r\n\r\n**Soy Lecithin**: Derived from GMO soy, this additive may contains toxins. According to The Cornucopia Institute, soy lecithin processing often involves hexane. Although it is removed in the processing, trace amounts can be left behind. That residue is not regulated by the FDA, even though it is listed as a potential carcinogen and neurotoxin.\r\n\r\n**Annatto**: While being a natural flavoring, WebMD stated it can affect blood sugar levels. Annatto has been linked to allergies, and the Food Intolerance Network has received reports linking it to headaches and irritability.\r\n\r\n**BHT:** Found in many cereals, this is another food classified by the FDA as GRAS. This means that experts consider BHT safe and it is approved as a food additive without additional testing of its effects. In 2014, the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an environmental safety watchdog group, released “Generally Recognized as Secret: Chemicals Added to Food in the U.S.” This report found loopholes in the GRAS classification, including research data coming from the company themselves and expert opinions that disregarded evidence of allergic reactions, that compromise the real safety of GRAS additives. BHT is also a chemical additive and may trigger Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\r\n\r\n**Extrusion process**: Many cereals are manufactured using an “extrusion process,” which exposes the cereal grains to high levels of heat and pressure, thereby changing the nature of the grain, and turning it into processed food. Biochemist Paul Stitt noted that extrusion process destroys most of the grains’ natural nutrients. This is why many cereals are “fortified,” although extrusion can destroy those added nutrients as well.\r\n\r\n**Fortified**: Many cereals try to cover up their high sugar content with fortification, which adds back in nutrients. As mentioned above, extrusion can deplete these nutrients. Also, fortified foods may contain too many nutrients, which can be toxic for your child.\r\n\r\n#### THE BAD CEREALS\r\n\r\nMamavation’s study of cereal’s “toxic ingredients” lists the top 10 cereals that children (and grown-ups) should avoid because they use extrusion processing, contain GMOs, and are fortified. Note: 4 grams is equivalent to 1 teaspoon.\r\n\r\n- Fruit Loops: Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, annatto, BHT, artificial dyes including red #40, 12g of sugar.\r\n- Fruit Loops with Marshmallows: Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, annatto, BHT, artificial dyes including red #40, 14g sugar.\r\n- Corn Pops: Hydrogenated coconut and soybean oil, annatto, BHT, 9g of sugar.\r\n- Apple Jacks: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, artificial dyes including red #40, BHT, 12g of sugar.\r\n- Honey Smacks: Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, soy lecithin, BHT, 15g of sugar.\r\n- Lucky Charms: Corn syrup, trisodium phosphate, artificial dyes including red #40, artificial flavor, 10g of sugar.\r\n- Boo Berry/Count Chocula/Franken Berry: Sugar, dextrose and corn syrup, canola oil, BHT, trisodium phosphate, artificial dyes including red #40, artificial flavor, 9g of sugar.\r\n- Trix: Corn syrup, BHT, trisodium phosphate, artificial dyes including red #40, 12g of sugar.\r\n- Fruity Pebbles: Hydrogenated vegetable oil, artificial dyes including red #40, artificial flavor, BHA, 9g of sugar.\r\n- Cap’n Crunch CrunchBerries: Artificial flavor, artificial dyes including red #40, BHT, 11g of sugar. Cap’n Crunch Oops! All Berries Cereal contains 15g of sugar.\r\n- Golden Crisps: Sugar, corn syrup, 14g of sugar.\r\n\r\n#### THE GOOD AND BAD CEREALS\r\n\r\nEWG’s analysis of more than 1,500 cereals, including more than 180 kid’s cereals, shows that a child who eats a bowl a day for a year ends up consuming 10 pounds of sugar. Their survey also revealed that 11 of the 13 most heavily sugared children’s cereals feature marketing claims such as “Good Source of Fiber” that suggest misleadingly that the products are healthy.\r\n\r\nSo how do you navigate the [grocery aisle](/can-your-water-be-killing-you-the-good-and-the-bad) to find the least sugary products? Check the list below to see which cereals have most and the least amount of sugar before you heading out. EWG recommends no more than 4 grams (1 teaspoon) of sugar per serving.\r\n\r\n![EWG-cereal-survey](/posts/EWG-cereal-survey.jpg)\r\n"

Do you get an alert ahead of time?\r\n\r\nBanks are imposing such fees because they’re offering more services to the consumer, and these services cost the banks money, says American Bankers Association. “When people say the number of potential fees has increased, it’s kind of disingenuous. We had limited services 30 or 50 years ago when there were no debit cards, no ATMs, no online banking, so there were less fees.”\r\n\r\n#### **<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">HOW TO SET UP ALERTS</span>**\r\n\r\nTo help assist their customers, many financial institutions have web-based tools to help better manage their accounts and can email or text alerts before it’s too late. Every financial institution has their alerts page displayed in a different part of their web site and the consumer’s challenge is to search and find where this page is hidden. It gets very frustrating when having more than one bank account.

      "content": "\r\nThere are a growing number of websites dedicated to raising money for creative and entrepreneurial projects, and fund raising.\r\n\r\nWhile Venture Capital (“VC”) companies invest in multi-million companies that are looking for additional sources of capital, and private high-wealth “Angels” invest in start-up companies as seen in the hit TV Show “The Shark Tank,” VC’s and Angels take ownership in the companies they are investing, and many times they want the controlling interest.\r\n\r\nThere are other alternatives to consider. Many individuals look to the Internet for crowdfunding sites to obtain start-up [capital](/finding-the-money-to-start-your-investment-portfolio). Crowdfunding has the potential to revolutionize how entrepreneurs raise money. Every crowdfunding site targets particular industry segments, for profit, and non-profit. Each crowdfunding site is different and the project creator and investors needs to carefully examine each site’s playbook. For many sites, if people like the proposed project they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers’ credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Not all crowdfunding sites are created equal. Here’s the breakdown on which may be the right one for you.\r\n\r\n1. [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/?ref=nav) – **Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology so long as it is for profit venture**. One of the most popular sites, boasts that over 9 million people have pledged $2.1 billion and over 96,000 projects have been funded. Kickstarter supports projects projects in arts, comics, crafts, dance, design, fashion, film &amp; video, food, games, journalism, music, photography, publishing, technology, and theater. Kickstarter’s charter is simple: Funding on Kickstarter is all or nothing. The majority of initial funding usually comes from the fans and friends of each project. How does Kickstarter make money? They receive a 5% fee to the funds collected, plus 3-5% of payment processing fees.\r\n2. [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/about/our-story) – A very **popular fund raising site for profit and non-profit** had over 275,000 campaigns launched. Pricing is similar to Kickstarter.\r\n3. [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/) – For those individuals who are looking to raise money for **medical bills, educational expenses, memorials, volunteer trips, and youth sports**. Cost: GoFundMe deducts a 5% fee from each donation that you receive plus a 3% processing fee.\r\n\r\nNavigate through the following chart to see which of 22 crowdfunding sites may be the best solution for you or click [here](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201306/eric-markowitz/how-to-choose-a-crowdfunder.html).![Raising money - Crowdfunding sites](/posts/inc-magazine-crowdfunding-infographic-june-2013_26652-807x1024.jpg)\r\n\r\n_Note: As with any investment, perform your due diligence and research. As an example, Quirky, one of the leading companies shown in the above Inc Magazine article, ran out of money and filed for bankruptcy._\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nExtra virgin olive oil is an excellent source of omega-9 fats. Studies have long shown that adding olive oil to a diet can lower risk of developing heart disease, stroke, some cancers, dementia, and can improve an individual’s life expectancy. New research now shows a new benefit of adding olive oil to an individual’s diet: it may counteract the harmful effects of air pollution.\r\n\r\nA study conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), explained that exposure to airborne “particulate matter” can lead to heart and lung diseases. Particulate matter is a mixture of the small particles and liquid droplets in the air that includes soil or dust particles, organic chemicals, acids, and metals. When the cells that line the interior surface of blood and lymphatic vessels (known as endothelial cells) are not functioning properly, it may lead to hardening of the arteries and a risk for other [cardiovascular diseases](/referred-pain-may-save-your-life-look-for-these-signs). So what can be done to thwart the effect of air pollution?\r\n\r\nThe EPA study was made up of 42 healthy men and women.\r\n\r\n- For 4 weeks, the participants received once a day either 3 grams of olive oil (in supplement form), 3 grams of fish oil, or no supplements (control group.) Note: 3 grams is approximately 1/10th of an ounce.\r\n- The participants were then exposed to controlled filtered air. The next day they were exposed to concentrated airborne particulate matter.\r\n- The results of the study showed that there were reductions in the dilation of the the major blood vessel of the upper arm (brachial artery), thereby potentially showing blood cell lining dysfunction in the control group (no supplements) and the fish oil group, but <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not</span> in the olive oil group.\r\n- The study also showed another benefit for the olive oil group. A protein known to help in the break down of blood clots was increased for the olive oil group.\r\n\r\nThe study’s concluded that the use of olive oil supplements in a diet may protect against the harmful vascular effects of exposure to air pollution particles.\r\n"

Data science’s hiring boom is tricky to measure, say analysts, because the field is so new that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t yet track specific hiring needs. In addition, the skill sets and responsibilities are still being defined at many companies, which likely will increase the recruiting challenge as hiring managers redefine what they seek on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n### ELECTRICAL ENGINEER JOBS\r\n\r\n![Electrical-Engineering- jobs](/posts/Electrical-Engineering-.jpg)  \r\nWhile demand for electrical engineers is expected to be strongest in Chicago, Houston and San Diego, the greatest supply of candidates will likely be in Los Angeles and New York, thus creating an imbalance, reported Randstad US, which also estimates that there are currently 17 openings for every electrical engineering candidate.\r\n\r\n### GENERAL AND OPERATIONS MANAGER\r\n\r\n![ops manager](/posts/ops-manager.jpg)  \r\nTo meet the expected 12.4 percent growth in demand that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates by 2022, recruiters will have to get busy soon. That growth rate translates into 613,000 open positions to fill for general and operations managers over the next seven years.\r\n\r\n### HOME HEALTH AID\r\n\r\n![home health aid jobs](/posts/home-health-aid-1024x682.jpg)  \r\nHiring is projected to rise by 48 percent over the next seven years, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says is a direct result of the aging population. Nearly 600,000 positions will need to be filled to meet the expected demand, while the low median salary of $20,820 limits the scope of the candidate pool.\r\n\r\n### INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYST\r\n\r\n![Information-Security jobs](/posts/Information-Security-1024x576.jpg)  \r\nThe proliferation of cloud-based technology is a driving force in the need for this job. Microsoft reported that by the beginning of next year, North American companies will need to employ at least 2.7 million cloud-computing workers, including information security analysts, and labor analysts say the supply can’t meet that demand.\r\n\r\n### MARKETING MANAGER JOBS\r\n\r\n![marketing mgr](/posts/marketing-mgr-1024x681.jpg)  \r\nWith the explosive growth in digital marketing and an already high average annual salary of $127,130, marketing managers are in very short supply, reported the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Looking to new college graduates to help fill the pipeline won’t suffice, as marketing is one of the skill sets most in demand by college recruiters, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers.\r\n\r\n### MEDICAL SERVICES MANAGER\r\n\r\n![jobs](/posts/med-services-2.jpg)  \r\nThe requirements for this position overlap the nation’s highest labor shortage industries, as estimated by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: health care, social assistance and professional business services. The BLS projects 73,300 new hires will be needed in the field by 2022, and predicts a 23 percent overall increase in employment.\r\n\r\n### PHYSICAL THERAPIST JOBS\r\n\r\n![jobs](/posts/physical-therapist-1024x680.jpg)  \r\nThe American Physical Therapy Association estimates that in 2016, demand for full-time [physical therapists](/which-jobs-have-the-highest-and-lowest-divorce-rate) will exceed 229,000, with a pool of candidates of around 196,000, creating a gap of 33,000 unfilled jobs. Like other health care fields, demand is up due to greater accessibility to health insurance and the aging population.\r\n\r\n### REGISTERED NURSE\r\n\r\n![nurse](/posts/nurse.jpg)  \r\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 19 percent growth rate by 2022, but it also estimates that 525,000 currently working registered nurses will have to be replaced due to retirements, which puts the total number of new hires anticipated at 1.05 million over the next seven years. In addition, the average age of working nurses is expected to rise to 44.6 from the current 42.7.\r\n\r\n### SOFTWARE ENGINEER JOBS\r\n\r\n![sw engineer](/posts/sw-engineer.jpeg)  \r\nThe Conference Board estimates there will be three jobs available for every new college graduate from a computer science program in 2016. There are many positions available as a remote or [virtual office worker](/70-companies-hire-remote-workers-virtual-jobs-uncovered). Not surprising, since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 222,600 software engineering jobs will need to be filled by 2022.\r\n"

It is considered one of the safest, all natural, and highly effective antiseptic and disinfectant. This simple compound has many useful benefits and can also save you a lot of money. What is Hydrogen peroxide, also known as H2O2? It is composed of water (H2O) with an extra oxygen (O) molecule. The Hydrogen peroxide “bond” breaks during a reaction, for example when you apply it to a cut on your finger. When you apply it, one of the oxygen molecules is freed, leaving H2O (water) behind. The freed oxygen molecule is what you see bubbling to the surface of the cut.\r\n\r\nA word of caution before you read further. Do not ingest hydrogen peroxide. It contains an assortment of stabilizers which shouldn’t be ingested. Large doses of hydrogen peroxide, even at the 3% concentration level, can cause oral blistering, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Only use it once to treat wounds. Do not use hydrogen peroxide on sensitive skin. Make sure you don’t overuse it, because it can kill good bacteria. While there are many strengths sold, for the uses below only use 3% pharmaceutical grade concentration that can be purchased at drugstore or supermarkets. Hydrogen peroxide will bleach or discolor many dark fabrics, so test on a small area before using.\r\n\r\n### Medicinal Uses\r\n\r\n![hydrogen peroxide feeling great](/posts/bigstock-Surprised-woman-90570578.jpg)\r\n\r\n- **Fights foot fungus**– There are reports that many people have successfully reduced foot fungus infections by mixing an equal part of hydrogen peroxide and water and spraying that solution on their feet every night. Let your feet dry after spraying.\r\n- **Cleans ear wax**– Before you consider removing your ear wax with hydrogen peroxide, make sure you do not have an ongoing ear infection, a perforated eardrum, severe ear pain or hearing impairment. Warm the hydrogen peroxide and olive oil bottles in a bowl of warm water to make ear wax removal more comfortable. To clean out ear wax, add a couple of drops of olive oil in your ear, and then follow it up with a couple drops of hydrogen peroxide. Keep your head tilted for about a minute, and then tilt it back the other way and let the mixture drain out. You may also want to gently flush your ear out with warm water.\r\n- **Helps toothache pain**– It’s Saturday night and you have a toothache. There’s no way to get a hold of your dentist. Dilute hydrogen peroxide in a cup of water, put some it in your mouth, and hold it there for a few minutes, spit it out, and rinse your mouth with fresh water.

This is the appropriate age to guide your child in the cost of college, credit cards, taxes, and IRA’s. _Money as You Grow_, an initiative from the President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability, provides parents with financially smart lessons with associated activities that children need to learn. The financially smart lessons and activities on the following pages are based on years of research, and drawn from dozens of academic studies.\r\n\r\n**Financially Smart Lesson**: Cost is a major factor to consider when comparing colleges.\r\n\r\n**Activities to reach milestone**:\r\n\r\n- Explain that kids that graduate college can earn about twice as much as money as compared to those who did not receive a college degree.\r\n- Discuss with your child how much money you can contribute to your child’s college tuition and expenses each year.\r\n- There are many loans, scholarships, and grants available to your child. Check out [Federal Aid](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/). Use their calculators to estimate monthly loan payments.\r\n- Go on-line with your child and compare [college costs](/way-too-easy-strategies-to-reduce-the-cost-of-college), and other factors so you and your child can see the big picture. You will also want to look at the colleges’ graduation rate, average monthly loan payment, loan default rate, and employment prospects. Visit the U.S. Department of Education”[College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)“\r\n- Since many parents don’t pay the tuition “sticker price,” look for the “net price calculator” on the college’s website.\r\n- To estimate the parent’s and student’s financial aid, use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid [FAFSA tools](https://fafsa.ed.gov/).\r\n\r\n### CREDIT CARD PRIMER\r\n\r\n![Financially Smart credit card](/posts/bigstock-Piggy-bank-or-credit-card-21749537.jpg)  \r\n**Financially Smart Lesson**: Avoid using a credit card to buy something you can’t afford\r\n\r\n**Activities to reach milestone**:\r\n\r\n- Teach your child a budget and create an [income and expenses budgeting worksheet](https://www.mymoney.gov/spend/Pages/spend.aspx).\r\n- Discuss with your child why having a savings and spending plan in place may help avoid using credit cards.\r\n- Explain that whenever you use a credit card, try to pay off the balance in full every month. If not, you may be charged a high interest rate on the balance. Also discuss the monetary and credit consequences if your child is late making a payment.\r\n- Show your child how long it could take to repay a $500 credit card debt by making the minimum monthly payments. [Check out this calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/credit-cards/credit-card-payoff-calculator.aspx).\r\n\r\n### TAXES\r\n\r\n![Financially Smart taxes](/posts/bigstock-Take-Some-Money-1612736.jpg)  \r\n**Financially Smart Lesson**: What is take-home pay?\r\n\r\n**Activities to reach milestone**:\r\n\r\n- Discuss with your child what is “gross pay”, that is money earned before taxes are taken out and what is “net pay”, the amount of money you actually take home.\r\n- Explain a W-4 form, which is required to be filled out before starting a job. The W-4 determines the amount of taxes deducted from a paycheck.\r\n- Discuss what taxes pay for, including schools, police, road repair, and medical assistance (disability).\r\n- If your child gets a steady job, set up an automatic savings program for your child so that at least 10% of his or her earnings goes directly into a savings account.\r\n\r\n### IRA ACCOUNT\r\n\r\n![Financially Smart IRA ](/posts/bigstock-Young-people-putting-money-in-23704928.jpg)  \r\n**Financially Smart Lesson**: A great place to save and invest earnings is in a Roth IRA.\r\n\r\n**Activities to reach milestone**:\r\n\r\n- Once your child gets a job, explain the benefits of opening a Roth Individual Retirement Account, which allows the interest he or she earns to grow tax free for life.\r\n- Explain to your child that once he or she starts working, their company may offer a similar account at work: a 401(k) plan. Some companies may provide matching contributions.\r\n\r\nWhat tips have you taught your child?\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nWhen [looking for a top job](/top-10-hot-jobs-for-2016/9), we often focus on the pay, benefits, commute time, challenges, opportunities for advancement but often don’t consider how this position may effect the relationship with your significant other. Work-life balance should be part of any decision making process. Which jobs have the highest and lowest divorce rate?\r\n\r\nResearchers at the Radford University used census data and a special algorithm to determine the divorce rates for over 500 careers in the U.S. The resulting percentages shown reflect the chances an individual in a particular career to experience divorce.\r\n\r\n#### CAREERS WITH THE HIGHEST DIVORCE RATE\r\n\r\n**Dancers and Choreographers** (43.05%) – The professional dancer’s lifestyle is not necessarily conducive to married life, which may be why this career has such a high divorce rate. In addition to being paid relatively low wages, which can play a significant role in causing divorce, dancers also work extremely long hours and are always on the road. Dancers do not need a college education, and lacking a college education is a factor tied to marriage happiness and likelihood of getting divorced.\r\n\r\n**Bartenders** (39.43%) – This may be no surprise that with the late nights, party atmospheres, and constant flirting with individuals of the opposite sex are likely reasons for the high divorce rate of this profession. Their lack of education and age (25 is the average age) may be additional factors.\r\n\r\n**Massage Therapists** (38.22%) – Massage therapy is a field that is highly dominated by women. A study conducted by Boston University, found that women who work are more likely to find themselves in divorce court than those that don’t. In addition, massage therapists spend a lot of time in close personal contact with repeat clients in private to semi-private settings. Considering that the best way to avoid adultery is to avoid temptation, this may be a large factor in the massage therapist divorce rate.\r\n\r\n**Gaming Cage Workers** (34.66%) – Location and alcohol without question are the two main factors individuals in this industry have some of the highest divorce rates. Nevada has the highest divorce rates. Individuals that work in casinos are more likely to suffer from alcohol abuse, depression, and smoking, all of which could play a significant role in their divorce rate. Additionally, the educational requirement for gaming cage workers is only a high school diploma, which could be another reason this career carries such a high divorce rate.  \r\n**Manufacturing -Extruding and Forming Machine Setters** (32.74%) – These workers fall into two categories that quickly lead to a marriage falling apart: low rates of income and lack of a college education. Individuals in this field often experience high unemployment. Since money problems is one of the top reasons individuals get divorced, it’s no wonder why this group has such a high divorce rate.\r\n\r\n#### CAREERS WITH THE LOWEST DIVORCE RATE\r\n\r\nFactors that make a marriage more enduring include having a college degree, sharing similar backgrounds, and having the same outlook on marriage, family, and kids. The following jobs are at the lowest part of the divorce spectrum.\r\n\r\n**Agricultural Engineers** (1.78%) – This field requires an advanced degree and the average income is high enough to stave off financial difficulties that can often cause marriages to fail. The higher levels of communication inherent within this type of position may play a vital role in keeping marriages together, since good communication is a necessity for marital success.\r\n\r\n**Optometrists** (4%) – Optometrists have a doctorate degree and earn an average of $100k a year. These two factors increase the probability for their marriages to work. Additionally, a number of the personal characteristics that make individuals successful as mates, also make a person successful in the optometry profession, including the ability to operate well under stress, the ability to accept criticism, and the willingness to compromise.\r\n\r\n**Military Members** (3.7%) – People often perceive individuals in the armed forces have a high divorce rate. In fact, the opposite is true, members of the military are less likely to get divorced. One reason may be that military members often spend time away from their spouses, sometimes in very dangerous situations, which may lead to the “absence makes the heart grow fonder” notion. Military members are also trained to work hard at whatever they do, which is a characteristic that may take a marriage a long way.\r\n\r\n**Clergy** (5.6%) – Clergy members often commit to work their marital problems out, a major factor to make a marriage more likely to work. Additionally, clergy act as role models for their parishioners, including providing marital counseling when asked. This higher knowledge of the benefits of honoring and respecting your spouse may play a role in keeping this group’s marriages together.  \r\n**Transit and Railroad Police** (5.26%) – A number of transit and railroad police positions are concentrated in New York, New Jersey, and California, known for low divorce rates. The income bracket for this profession is best suited for a workable marriage, between $50 and $75k per year. Another factor that is crucial in keeping this career’s divorce rate low is a bachelor’s degree is required for this position.\r\n\r\n#### DIVORCE RATES FOR SOME POPULAR CAREERS\r\n\r\n- **Entertainers and Professional Athletes – 28.49%**\r\n- **Writer/Author – 15.92%**\r\n- **Veterinarians – 11.04%**\r\n- **Pilot – 10.96%**\r\n- **Scientists – 8.79%**\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nCredit card scams are at an all time high and credit card companies are constantly attempting to close the fraudulent loop holes as fast as new ones surface. The U.S. credit card industry is currently going through a massive change as it switches over to “chip based” cards. The EMV credit cards (the acronym came from “Europay, MasterCard, and Visa”) have been widely used in Europe for many years. Banks have been sending out new credit and debit cards that have an embedded microchip to meet an October 2015 liability change deadline. However, the credit card scammers are still out there.\r\n\r\n#### New Chip Technology\r\n\r\nThe new EVM credit cards being issued provide more security because the computer chip creates and encrypts a new number every time the card is used. The older cards stores payment data in the magnetic stripe on the back of the card. The magnetic stripe is easy to steal, replicate, and put on fake cards. Since everyone has not received a new card, credit card scams are poised to take advantage.\r\n\r\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3291\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3291\" style=\"width: 640px\">\r\n\r\n![EMV Credit Card Chip](/posts/EMV-credit-card.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-3291\">EMV Credit Card Chip</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n#### New Credit Card Chip Email Scam\r\n\r\nScammers are sending out bogus emails pretending to be credit card companies. The email will state that the consumer needs to update their credit card account by emailing a reply confirming personal information or clicking on a link in order to get their upgraded card, according to The Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Fraudsters then use the provided information to steal a consumer’s identity. At this time, EMV cards will not stop credit card fraud involved in online purchases.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Do not trust an email link. If you have any issues with your credit card, always call the telephone number on the back of your card.\r\n\r\n#### Skimming Machines\r\n\r\nSkimming machines or “skimmers” have become high tech. Skimmers have been found connected to gas pumps credit card machines and ATMs throughout the U.S. A skimmer is a crude piece of plastic placed directly over the slot where you insert your credit or ATM card into the machine. This piece of plastic is designed to “read” the information off the magnetic strip from the back of the consumer’s card. The skimmer collects credit card data and then transfer to the scammers via Bluetooth, who can then replicate the cards and go on a spending spree.\r\n\r\nLess technological skimming tricks include restaurant staff and retail employees skimming your credit card information and then using it to make small purchases that are very often missed by the victim.![Credit card scams, the skimmer](/posts/bigstock-Illustration-of-a-Thief-Instal-85431035-Converted.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Look carefully at the ATM or credit card machine that you are using and run your hand firmly over the slot that you insert your card into making sure that it doesn’t wiggle around. If so, don’t use it and report it to the merchant or bank. Also, keep all your credit card receipts in an envelope and check the totals against your monthly credit card statements. [Report any discrepancies](/how-to-dispute-a-credit-card-charge) immediately to your credit card company to avoid fraudulent charges.\r\n\r\n#### ATM Machine Spies\r\n\r\nIn addition to skimmers, criminals have been known to use high powered binoculars or cameras to peer over the card holder’s shoulder to obtain consumer’s banking information. ![credit card scam Businessman using binoculars, money reflected in the lens](/posts/Businessman-using-binoculars-1024x688.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Use ATM’s located inside a bank. Place your free hand over the one that is entering the PIN to hide it from anyone that may be spying on you.\r\n\r\n#### Cell Phone Camera Spies\r\n\r\nAnother camera capture trick may happen when a “would be shopper” appears to be talking on their cell phone nearby the check out register while you are paying for a purchase. Or he/she appears to be talking on their cell phone outside a restaurant’s window, while you are inside using your credit card to pay for a meal.\r\n\r\nWhile the would be shopper or bystander appears to be deeply engrossed in their conversation, he/she may be using their cell phone camera to take pictures of your credit card number information.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Be aware of strangers getting too close to you when using your credit card at retail establishment, especially when they appear to be talking on their phone.\r\n\r\n#### Keystroke Logger Spyware\r\n\r\nMany computers are infected with “keystroke logger” spyware that may have been installed on your computer. Victims often download and install keystroke logger spyware without realizing that they are doing so. According to the Better Business Bureau, in one such scam “Thousands of high-ranking executives across the country received an e-mail message that appeared to be official subpoenas from the United States District Court in San Diego. Each message includes the executive’s name, company and phone number, and commands the recipient to appear before a grand jury in a civil case.” A link embedded in the message offers the recipient a copy of the subpoena. Once clicked to view the link, they unknowingly install the keystroke software that records all their subsequent keystrokes, including credit card numbers, user ID’s and passwords. When an online purchase is subsequently made, the scammer is able to obtain the victim’s credit card number.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Do not click on any links from someone you do not know. If you receive an email from someone you do know, but you aren’t sure if the content is legitimate, call them before clicking the link. Also, purchase and install a current Internet security program to help thwart an attack.\r\n\r\n_Note: If you think you are a victim of a credit card scam or fraud, call your credit card company immediately to have your account suspended and have a new card issued. Additionally, you should call the credit bureaus and get a hold put on your credit reports._\r\n"

So what can be done to save money on child care? Look at these cost-savings alternatives.\r\n\r\nDrop-in before and after school programs offered through churches, YMCA, and Boys and Girls Clubs are affordable childcare alternatives to [daycare centers](/6-unique-ideas-for-saving-on-childcare).

The cost to care for two children is higher than for the care of a single child, but when two families split the total cost, it’s less expensive than employing two separate babysitters. The children also benefit by increasing their social interaction with another child.\r\n\r\n### BABYSITTING EXCHANGE\r\n\r\n![save money on child care with shared baby sitter](/posts/shared-babysitter-1024x512.jpg)  \r\nIf a parent is looking to run an errand, work at home for a period of uninterrupted time, or just enjoy a date night, swapping babysitting hours with another parent can be an affordable solution for those occasional babysitting needs. This is another way to save money on child care.\r\n\r\n### BABYSITTING COOPERATIVES- AND SAVE MONEY ON CHILD CARE\r\n\r\n![co-op save money on child care](/posts/coop-1024x768.jpg)  \r\nCreating or joining a babysitting co-op in your area may be an affordable option to consider, as compared to a private daycare center. When you join a co-op, the members trade instead of paying. Members get free babysitting in return for providing free babysitting for others.

The answer is yes. Although there are ways to [save money on college](/way-too-easy-strategies-to-reduce-the-cost-of-college), many people are opting out for Plan B: skipping the longer path of a 4 year college degree and still wind up with a high paying position.\r\n\r\n#### Plan B\r\n\r\nWithout obtaining a bachelor’s degree (B.A. or B.S.), Plan B students are still able to earn more money than many four year college graduates. Many four year college graduates have difficulty finding a job, some individuals who major in fields such as humanities make less money than their peers, and many students obtaining degrees in math, engineering, science or technology are not employed in the fields they studied in college.\r\n\r\nSo what is Plan B? Plan B students take programs in a trade or vocational school. These schools focus on putting their students on a more defined track to succeed in the job market. Many of the high paying entry level jobs can be attained in two years or less.![trade school](/posts/bigstock-Young-adults-in-business-train-12524651.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### Technical vs. Vocational Schools\r\n\r\nTechnical schools teach the “science” behind the occupation, while vocational schools focus on hands-on application of skills needed to do the job. You may earn a diploma or a certificate, prepare for a licensing exam, or study to begin work as an apprentice or journeyman in a skilled trade.![Vocational training](/posts/bigstock-Vocational-education-student-l-69006538.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### Careers To Consider\r\n\r\nFor many of the following careers, a two year associate’s degree (A.A.) is required. And for some of them, a high school (H.S.) diploma or certificate is enough to get you started. Check with your state government for any specific requirements.\r\n\r\n_Note: Salary and job growth data shown below is taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 2014.

Not every pain is a cause of panic. But there are some mystery pains that we should never ignore, and many are signs to seek immediate medical help, just to be sure. Pay attention to these telltale signs and messages that a referred pain is signaling you.\r\n\r\nEver get a “brain freeze” or an ice-cream headache? This is called a referred pain. Referred pain means that a problem exists somewhere else in the body other than where you feel the pain, according to WebMd. For example, your pancreas is located in the upper middle part of the abdomen. When it becomes inflamed (called pancreatitis), it becomes a potentially serious disorder. Many patients feel radiating pain in their back or in some cases the left shoulder. This is because the nerves fibers of the pancreas and left shoulder piggyback each other and travel together over the same route. You may not associate a jaw pain with heart attack and you’ll probably dismiss it as usual random pain. But a painful jaw may mean that your heart is stressed, and a heart attack may be imminent.\r\n\r\nThe following are some examples of referred pain, and it is not an exhaustive list. This information is not intended to be a medical diagnosis for any symptoms that you may experience. It is for informational purpose only, so you are aware what signals your body may be sending you. Always seek medical attention and consult with a physician especially if you have chest pain, severe headache or stiff neck, or pain accompanied by weakness or numbness.\r\n\r\n### Shoulder Pain\r\n\r\n![Shoulder referred pain](/posts/bigstock-Woman-With-Pain-In-Shoulder-P-98598713.jpg)  \r\nCauses of shoulder pain may be attributable to many other health problems including:\r\n\r\n- Abdominal problems, including gallstones and pancreatitis\r\n- Pelvic problems, including a ruptured ovarian cyst.\r\n- Heart and blood vessel problems in which pain is more often felt in the left arm and shoulder, including a heart attack.\r\n- [Lung problems](/7-houseplants-that-improve-your-health-and-clean-pollutants-from-your-home), such as pneumonia.\r\n\r\n### Jaw Pain\r\n\r\n![jaw referred pain](/posts/bigstock-Jaw-Pain-In-Older-Man-69029920.jpg)  \r\nA dull, vague pain on the lower left side of your jaw should never be ignored. This pain may increase and decrease over the course of a few minutes. In addition, the pain may move around so you may not be able to pinpoint exactly where it bothers you. This referred pain sensation occurs when the nerves surrounding the heart become agitated, sending pain through the nerves in the spine to the left jaw, shoulder and arm. Jaw pain that happens in the morning can be an instance of referred pain and serves as a warning sign that you may be at risk for a heart attack. Your blood is thicker in the morning, which causes blood pressure to surge, increasing heart attack risk as pointed out by Dr. Oz. You may also get additional classic heart attack signs such as shortness of breath, dizziness or nausea. In this case, see a doctor immediately.\r\n\r\n### Ear Pain\r\n\r\n![ear referred pain](/posts/bigstock-Young-woman-with-a-pain-in-her-76862783-300x267.jpg)  \r\nThe causes of ear pain may stem from other parts of your body. According to one Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor, 40% of patients coming to their offices with ear pain was found not to have ear infections, but other root causes such as:\r\n\r\n- If you have pain over the mastoid- Sciatica, disc herniation or other cervical spine diseases, whiplash\r\n- If there is pain or discomfort in front of your ear – TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disease, dental problems, tumors, or infection\r\n- If you feel discomfort or pain deep in your ear – Sinusitis or tonsillitis\r\n- If there is discomfort in your ear/ear canal pain – Acid reflux (GERD), tumors, or tonsillitis\r\n\r\n### Back Pain\r\n\r\n![back referred pain](/posts/bigstock-Backache-concept-bending-over-96285692.jpg)  \r\nBack pain is a symptom of an underlying cause. While it may be due to some heavy weekend lifting, it may also be a result of having:\r\n\r\n- Appendicitis\r\n- Aneurysm\r\n- Kidney disease\r\n- Bladder infections, pelvic infections, or ovarian disorders\r\n\r\n### Severe headache\r\n\r\n![severe headache referred pain](/posts/bigstock-Business-Woman-Stress-And-Head-52797175-1024x768.jpg)  \r\nIf you get a sudden and severe headache, the absolute worst headache of you have ever experienced that may be accompanied with other migraine symptoms such as a visual aura (losing part or all of one’s vision for a short period of time, or seeing zig-zag or squiggly lines) may be symptomatic of a brain aneurysm. These arterial bulges in your brain occur in up to 5 percent of people. Many times they don’t cause any issues and you won’t even know you have one unless the weak spot leaks or tears. If that happens, escaping blood can flood the surrounding tissue causing a violent headache and cut off the oxygen supply. If you get these symptoms, call 911 immediately.\r\n\r\nDo you have a story to share?\r\n"

There are many pollutants in the air, and home air filters can only do so much to detoxify what we breath. NASA, in association with the Associated Landscape Contractors of America, studied houseplants as a way to purify the air. The joint study concluded there are many houseplants that filter out chemicals, many of which are found in household cleaning products.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Dutch researchers found that hospital patients who had plants in their room had lower stress level than those without them. The American Society for Horticultural Science’s study found three common house plants were able to filter some of the ozone released indoors from copy machines, laser printers, and ultraviolet lights. The toxic effects of ozone on humans are pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, inflammation, and [reduced lung function](/referred-pain-may-save-your-life-look-for-these-signs).\r\n\r\nThe benefits of some indoor houseplants not only detoxifies the air breath, but it can also can reduce colds, increase brain functions, reduce stress, lower anxiety, and may get you a better night’s sleep. Here are some beautiful plants that have a hidden medicinal effect on you.\r\n\r\n## English Ivy\r\n\r\nEnglish Ivy is the number one plant endorsed by the NASA study, as it may help respiratory problems and asthma. This plant has a purifying score of 7.8 and it is the most effective plant when it comes to absorbing formaldehyde, commonly found in cleaning products, toilet paper, tissues and personal care products. English Ivy has been known to reduce airborne mold by 78% and fecal matter particles by 58%.

NASA’s study showed that the Aloe Vera plant is one of the best plants to improve the air quality since it produces oxygen at night. These plants may provide you with a better night’s sleep.\r\n\r\n### Spider Plant![Spider plant is one of many houseplants that can improve your health](/posts/bigstock-Spider-Plant-On-White-101203397-1024x1024.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe Spider Plant made NASA’s list of one of the best air purifying houseplants.

      "content": "\r\nThere are many factors to consider when selecting the best cash back rewards credit card. Credit card companies change their plans frequently, and most give the consumer a short window of opportunity to select their promotional plan.\r\n\r\nMany consumers are enticed with emails and mailers from credit card companies that state “sign up now and get 40,000 free points.” A diligent consumer should first spend time researching alternative credit card companies before acting on that special offer. Make the right choice.\r\n\r\n## Cash Back Rewards\r\n\r\nObtaining money back or points from a credit card company is a great enticement to use your credit card more often. Before making that large purchase, be sure there will be sufficient money in your checking or savings account to pay off your monthly credit card bill. Credit card companies’ reward programs differ from one card to another. One size does not fit all. Check cardratings.com and compare which card gives you the most back when you spend money on groceries, gas, restaurants, and other purchases.\r\n\r\nThe following are the two “overall winners” for February 2016, but check their website to see which cash back rewards card is best suited for you.![cash back rewards card bofa](/posts/bofa.jpg)![cash back rewards card chase](/posts/chase.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Criteria\r\n\r\nCardRatings.com offers this advise when analyzing cash back rewards programs.\r\n\r\n- **What do you need**: Think about this before applying. What’s your goal? You’ll make a better decision if you can visualize how and when you will use the rewards.\r\n- **What are the bells and whistles**: 5% cash back is very catching, but if it’s in a category you’ll never use, that makes it 0%. Since many of us are creatures of habit, look at your past spending patterns as a guide for future purchases.\r\n- **Know your credit score**: Applying for many different credit cards at once and get rejected can seriously damage your credit. [Credit scoring companies such as FICO ](/how-to-get-tricky-with-raising-your-credit-score)may assume you are in an emergency situation and are about to binge on credit. Apply only for cards that you are sure you will be approved for. The credit card comparison chart shows what type credit is required.\r\n- **Read the fine print**: What are the fees on the back end that may wipe out any potential gains. Look beyond the teaser rates. What will trigger a rate increase? Are there any annual fees? Some deals are so alluring that paying an annual fee still nets out to a great reward. It’s best to look at this long-term.\r\n- **Change in lifestyle**: Periodically review your spending situation and make sure your cards are working for you. Find a new card if the current one is not working for you or the credit card company changed their rewards program.\r\n- **Over spending**: If you aren’t able to pay off the credit card balance in full each month, interest charges will eat away or perhaps negate any rewards.\r\n- **Miles or Rewards**: This decision depends on an individual’s lifestyle and goals. To make the correct decision, look at the dollar equivalent of a mile or point then think about your use cases. If someone flies on a specific airlines twice a month, then the earning potential of getting that branded airlines credit card might allow the miles to accrue so fast that realizing rewards is a snap. If another consumer doesn’t fly or stay in hotels often, then a cash back card is the better and quicker path to getting the cash to spend on a flight or hotel stay in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat card works for you?\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nEveryone is looking for ways to save money on groceries since it is one of our largest expenses. Walmart has a reputation for being a low-price leader. That’s not the case anymore when it comes to purchasing grocery items, according to a new cost comparison survey. The price check shows that a new supermarket chain was about 30% cheaper than Walmart.\r\n\r\nThe German based Aldi supermarket chain, parent company of Trader Joe’s, has emerged as a low-price leader in many categories. Aldi is short for Albrecht Discount. Business Insider compared the prices of 34 items at an Aldi store in Richmond, VA to an identical set of items at a nearby Walmart store. The findings: Aldi’s shopping cart was approximately 30% less expensive than Walmart’s cart. Also, blogger Erin Kelly conducted a price check at an Aldi market in Manhattan, KS and found Aldi was 22% less expensive than WalMart. “With the exception of the milk and eggs, which usually are cheaper at Aldi, every single item was cheaper at Aldi than Wal-Mart,” Kelly wrote on her blog. “Every penny adds up.”\r\n\r\nHere’s some details of the shopping comparison conducted by Business Insider:\r\n\r\n- Aldi’s shopping cart totaled $89.48. Walmart’s cart was $115.86. (Note: they accounted for the products’ varying package sizes and calculated those differences into the final price.)\r\n- Aldi was less expensive in fresh produce and packaged goods.\r\n- The biggest price difference was on peanut butter, flour, grapefruit, flour tortillas, butter, quinoa, apples, and coconut oil. Flour was $2.16 cheaper at Aldi, four sticks of butter were $1.28 cheaper, and 16 ounces of quinoa was $2.93 cheaper, compared to Walmart. Aldi’s creamy peanut butter cost $2.99 for 40 ounces and Walmart’s Great Value brand cost $4.37 for the same amount.Three pounds of gala apples cost $2.99 at Aldi and $4.41 at Walmart, and a whole grapefruit cost $0.79 at Aldi and $1.28 at Walmart.\r\n- Walmart was less expensive for 6 items: skinless boneless chicken breasts, tomatoes, organic bananas, milk, and eggs.\r\n\r\nWhen asked to comment about the price check, Walmart spokesman John Forrest Ales noted that Walmart will match prices “advertised” by other retailers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Business Insider, Aldi keeps their prices low by limiting inventory to a lean selection of private-label items and selling very few major brands. They invest less in customer service, and merchandising than traditional markets. Aldi saves money by requiring customers to bring their own shopping bags, bag their own groceries, and pay a $0.25 deposit to use carts. The deposit is refunded when customers return the carts, so Aldi doesn’t have to pay employees to round them up and return them to the front of the store. Aldi Workers don’t have to unpack boxes of groceries to stock them on shelves. The products are delivered in boxes with an open side, so they can be thrown onto a shelf without being unpacked. The end result: Aldi’s customers [save money on groceries](/16-smartphone-apps-that-pay-you).\r\n\r\nAldi has 1,400 stores nationwide and more than 19,000 employees in 32 states. They just revealed plans to open approximately 600 more stores across the U.S. The first 25 stores will open in Southern California by July 2016.

No more annoying office disruptions or having your boss look over your shoulder.\r\n\r\nBrie Weiler Reynolds, Director of Online Content at FlexJobs, uncovered over 70 companies that operate almost or in a total virtual work environment. The people who work for these virtual companies have also been referred to as distributed team members, telecommuters, or “work from home” employees. Virtual companies embrace “the idea that company culture, effectiveness, and productivity can not only survive, but thrive outside a traditional office environment.”\r\n\r\n## ![virtual jobs working at hoem](/posts/bigstock-Mother-working-in-home-office-94483265.jpg)Virtual Jobs – What Are The Various Types Of Companies That Employ Remote Workers?\r\n\r\nVirtual jobs may be found at software companies, on-line learning and education, medical, publishing, writing, web development, digital marketing and many more.

Check out the company’s website, see if you are a fit, view the qualifications for any open positions, and fill out an application. Visit “work from home”, telecommuting or virtual office discussion groups and forums to better understand what a typical day is like, and the skills needed to complete their job responsibilities and communicate with other team members.

The financial management lessons and activities on the following pages are based on more than a year of research, and drawn from dozens of standards, curricula, and academic studies.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with a “savings” lesson and activities.\r\n\r\n**Practical Money Lesson**: Save at least 10 cents for every dollar received.\r\n\r\n**Activities to reach milestone**:\r\n\r\n- Encourage your child to always save 10% of the money received, whether it is a gift, allowance, or money earned.\r\n- Ask your child set a goal to buy something they would like, and have them work toward that amount.\r\n- Open a [savings account](/how-to-get-your-moneys-worth-from-checking-accounts) at a bank. There are many banks that waive fees for children. To encourage savings, go to the bank several times a year with your child to deposit savings into their account. Show them how the balance has grown on each visit.\r\n- Consider contributing to your child’s savings with a “matching plan.” For example, deposit 25 cents for every dollar they save.\r\n\r\n### Personal Information\r\n\r\n![Practical money lessons - personal information](/posts/bigstock-Mother-looking-after-son-doing-87393188-10-year-old.jpg)  \r\n**Practical Money Lesson**: Entering personal information, such as a bank or credit card number, on-line is very risky because someone could steal it.\r\n\r\n**Activities to reach milestone**:\r\n\r\n- Discuss with your child the dangers of entering personal information on-line.\r\n- Explain that thieves can use their Social Security number or other personal information to open a new credit card or create fake documents with your name.\r\n- Explain that a company does not give something away for free, without a catch. A free on-line offer, such as games or cell phone ringtones, are typically scams to get people to spend money without realizing it, or provide personal information for phishing.\r\n- Explain to your child to never reply to an email from someone they don’t know, if the subject matter is inappropriate, and never clicks on pop-up ads.\r\n- Visit [Federal Trade Commission Identity Theft web site](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft) with your child for tips on information security.\r\n\r\n### How Savings Can Grow\r\n\r\n![Practical money lessons - grow money](/posts/bigstock-Growing-money-in-flowerpots-on-92069222-1024x703.jpg)  \r\n**Practical Money Lesson**: The sooner you save, the faster your money can grow by using compound interest.\r\n\r\n**Activities to reach milestone**:\r\n\r\n- Define “compound interest.” This is when you earn interest on both the money you save and the interest you earn.\r\n- Show your child the following example: Saving $100 every year starting at age 14 would grow to about $23,000 at age 65, assuming the account earns 5% every year. However, if your child started saving at age 35 he/she would have about $7,000 at age 65.\r\n- Visit the calculators with your child at investor.gov to [compute compound interest](https://investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator).\r\n- Discuss how much your child can save. What will your child have to give up? Is it worth it?\r\n\r\n### Credit Card\r\n\r\n![Practical money lessons - credit card](/posts/bigstock-A-young-buyer-with-colored-bag-107959439.jpg)  \r\n**Practical Money Lesson**: Using a credit card is like taking out a loan. If you don’t pay your bill in full every month, you’ll be charged interest and owe more than you originally spent.\r\n\r\n**Activities to reach milestone**:\r\n\r\n- Discuss why you should not use a credit card to buy something that you can’t afford to pay for with cash.\r\n- Look at credit card offers on-line with your child, and compare the interest rates.\r\n- Use a [Credit Card Repayment Calculator](https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/how-long-will-it-take-to-pay-off-my-credit-card) to see how long it could take to repay a $2,000 credit card debt by making the minimum monthly payments.\r\n- Discuss how a credit card can be useful for making purchases on-line.\r\n\r\nWhat other financial tips have you taught your children?\r\n"

Many people may not be sure the best way to get started or what to expect. There are 3 key factors to consider before making a commitment, as reported by Lauren Greutman.\r\n\r\nAll mystery shopping sites are not alike. There are hundreds of scam sites just waiting to take a bite out of your wallet. To be better informed, explore these websites to gather information, get the inside scoop, and determine which mystery shopping sites would be your best fit.\r\n\r\n- MSPA-NA – (formerly known as the Mystery Shopping Providers Association of North America) is the trade association representing the customer experience industry throughout North America. Perform a[ member search](https://www.mspa-na.org/search).\r\n- Volition – View the [get paid forums](https://www.volition.com/getpaid.html) at Volition.com. “There are sites that claim to pay us for everything. Here we discuss which are worthwhile and which are scams. If you are interested in learning about Mystery Shopping, this is where you need to look.”\r\n- BestMark – [Bestmark](https://www.bestmark.com/) has been “providing over 30 years of innovative and reliable mystery shopping and customer experience solutions for industry-leading organizations.”\r\n\r\n  ### Mystery Shopper Expectations![mystery shopper at restaurant](/posts/bigstock-woman-at-restaurant-chef-pour-15609941.jpg)\r\n\r\n  After selecting the sites you want to work with, have some reasonable expectations on how much money you will earn. Each job that is contracted pays the same fee regardless of experience. Greutman reported that:\r\n\r\n- Restaurant mystery shopper earns between $25 to $100 -Plan to spend about an hour, or however long it may take to eat; and approximately another 30 minutes to complete the [survey](/the-6-best-on-line-survey-sites-that-pay-money/3).\r\n- Phone call and on-line mystery shopper can earn around $3 to $5. Calls and on-line shopping tend to take around 5 minutes. Add an 10 minutes or so to complete a survey. As a mystery shopper gains experience, he/she becomes more proficient filling out surveys and can cut down the time to fill them out. A good time management technique is to plan shop visits around daily routines.\r\n\r\n  ### Figure Out How Much Time Each Task Takes Before Committing![mystery shopper in traffic](/posts/bigstock-urban-traffic-jam-in-a-city-st-94396547-1024x684.jpg)\r\n\r\n  Your time is valuable. Factor in travel time, the possibility of getting stuck in traffic, finding a parking spot, time on the job, and the time to complete a survey. Look for shops that will work for your needs and schedule. While it’s great to get another “free meal” at a restaurant, you may benefit more by reviewing the “free haircut” at a beauty salon.\r\n\r\n  Note: Start off with one or two shops, fill out the survey, and get feedback. A mystery shopper needs to remember a lot of detail. If your report isn’t accepted, you won’t get paid or be reimbursed for your expenses. Greutman noted that while the “favorite shops were the ones that were at very nice restaurants…being able to receive free drinks, delicious food, and more, all for free…the main con is that sometimes the surveys take a long time to complete. Surveys can also be quite tedious to do.”\r\n\r\n  What are some of your mystery shopper tips?\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n### Distilled Water\r\n\r\nThere are many water selections to choose from when walking down your supermarket aisle. What factors do you consider when buying water? Price, brand name, or what’s on special? All water is not the same. The ideal water that is consumed should be slightly alkaline and this requires the presence of minerals, like magnesium and calcium. So what does store bought water contain and what is really good for your body? How does it compare with your home filtered or tap water?\r\n\r\nDistillation involves boiling water and then condensing the steam into a clean container. Since distilled water does not contain any corrosive minerals or ions, it is used to top off automotive lead acid batteries and cooling systems.\r\n\r\nDistilled water is void of any dissolved minerals, so it can actively absorb toxic substances from the body and eliminate them when consumed. However, distilled water tends to be acidic and can only be recommended as a way of drawing poisons out of the body. Once this is accomplished, the continued drinking of distilled water is a bad idea. The more distilled water a person drinks, the higher the body acidity becomes.\r\n\r\nCooking foods in distilled water pulls the minerals out of the foods and lowers their nutrient value.\r\n\r\nDistilled water has some great benefits when used in steam irons and humidifiers. Regular tap water will increase mineral build up and diminish the humidifier’s and steam iron’s effectiveness. Distilled water is also used in Constant Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines. The water is used to humidify the air entering the user’s mouth, throat, and the nasal cavity. Distilled water will not leave any contaminants behind when the humidifier in the CPAP machine evaporates the water.\r\n\r\n![Drinking soda](/posts/bigstock-Watching-An-Exciting-Movie-91323602-1024x681.jpg)The next time you buy your favorite brand of soda, look at the label. According to Dr. Rona Zoltan, soft drinks are made from distilled water. Studies have shown that heavy consumption of soft drinks, with or without sugar, throw off huge amounts of calcium, magnesium and other trace minerals into the urine. The more our body depletes minerals, the risk increases for coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, and other degenerative diseases associated with premature aging.\r\n\r\n### Bottled Water\r\n\r\n![Bottled water](/posts/bigstock-Image-of-many-plastic-bottles-13784084.jpg)Are they all the same? Purified, mineral, and spring water? Bottle labels make claims such as “purified through a rigorous process,” “enhanced with minerals,” “purity guaranteed,” or “water filtered through mineral rich layers.” So what are the best bottled water brands and the ones that are best for your body? Facing a slump in sales of carbonated soft drinks due to health concerns, beverage companies are increasingly relying on bottled water revenue. According to the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA), total 2014 sales revenues for US bottled water were $13 billion in wholesale dollars. Americans consumed 12 billion gallons of bottled water, or about 34 gallons per person. The three largest beverage companies are:\r\n\r\n- Nestlé – They produce bottled water under various brand names depending on the region. These brands include Arrowhead, Calistoga, Deer Park, Ice Mountain, Ozarka, Poland Spring, Pure Life, and Zephyrhills. Nestle says its Pure Life water is purified through a 12-step process, including reverse osmosis and distillation.\r\n- PepsiCo – Produces Aquafina. New labels will spell out _“public water source,”_ acknowledging the bottled brand’s shared origin with tap water. Aquafina is then purified through a seven-step process, stripping it of minerals and other contents commonly found in municipal water supply.\r\n- Coca-Cola – They produce Dasani. Coke acknowledged the “public origins” of Dasani back in 2013, but maintains that the purification process distinguishes it from tap water. Dasani’s label states it is purified water.\r\n\r\n#### Purified bottled water\r\n\r\nThe bottling companies, with the exception of just a very few, use extreme “filtration” processes including reverse osmosis, distillation, and deionization; in addition to “ozonation,” which infuses water with oxygen to kill germs before bottling it. The ozonation process has been reported to also add too many free radicals to the water. Neither of these processes make the water healthier, and they are not better than what your water company does at all. See chart below. Plus the extreme measures of filtration tend to make “purified bottled water” more acidic.\r\n\r\n#### pH Level\r\n\r\nTo keep our blood the right pH level, 7.4, we should drink water at a high pH level. Drinking alkaline water helps the body detoxify. Toxins are acids, and to maintain pH balance while you are detoxifying, one needs an abundance of alkaline buffers.\r\n\r\nBottled water with low pH levels (5.0 or under) include: Vitaminwater 3.4, Propel Zero 3.5, Propel Fitness Water 3.5, Penta 4.0, Dasani 4.5, and Kirkland water 5.0 (same as WalMart, Safeway’s Refreshe, and Niagara)\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The following waters contain a pH level of 7.0 and higher and helps the body detoxify:</span>\r\n\r\n- Evian 7.2 (Spring water from France)\r\n- Vittel 7.5 (France)\r\n- VOSS 7.6\r\n- Volvic 7.0 (Filtered treated spring water)\r\n- Arrowhead Water 7.0\r\n- Poland Spring 7.2\r\n- Deer Park 7.0\r\n- Crystal Geyser 7.0\r\n- Zephyrhills 7.5 (Filtered treated spring water)\r\n- Fiji 7.5 (spring water from Fiji)\r\n- Whole Foods 365 Water 7.5\r\n- Mountain Valley 8.35 (Hot Springs, AR)\r\n- **New York City tap water 7.0**\r\n- **Los Angeles tap water 7.5**\r\n- **St. Louis tap water 9.5**\r\n\r\n### Filtered Water\r\n\r\n![Water filters](/posts/bigstock-Filter-system-for-water-treatm-60280706.jpg)\r\n\r\nWater filtered through reverse osmosis tends to be neutral and is acceptable for regular use provided minerals are supplemented.\r\n\r\n![water filter](/posts/EWG-2.jpg)What is the best water filtered system? EWG, a non-profit and non-partisan organization produced a water [filter buying guide](https://www.ewg.org/research/ewgs-water-filter-buying-guide) so consumers can find the best system based upon cost, effectiveness, water softener agents, and ones that removes specific contaminants.\r\n"

While they usually wear great, they may get worn, lose their shape, or just go out of style. Before deciding to give away some of your favorite denims, you may want to consider some inventive and easy DIY ways to renew and make them again fashionable.\r\n\r\nDistressing your old pair of denims is easily done at home with just a few simple tools and tricks. American Eagle Outfitters created a great post with [step-by-step directions](https://blog.ae.com/2014/10/10/do-a-distressed-denim-diy/). You will need:\r\n\r\n- **Sandpaper**– for light distressing and breaking down the denim fabric\r\n- **Razor blade** – scrapes away surface threads and cuts seams\r\n- **Scissors** – for hole making\r\n- **Block of wood** – to fit inside the jeans to provide a smooth surface and ensure that only one side is being distressed\r\n- **Bleach** – to make some bold statements. Insert cardboard inside the jeans to prevent bleeding.\r\n\r\n### Lace Cuffs Jeans![lace jeans](/posts/bigstock-Nice-sexy-woman-holding-scroll-79831126-1024x801.jpg)\r\n\r\nEmbellish your old jeans or shorts with lace on the cuffs or the bottoms. Sew on beads and sequins in a fun pattern, or use fabric paint with a cute stencil design and decorate your shorts.\r\n\r\n### Create Shorts![jean shorts](/posts/bigstock-blue-denim-shorts-on-a-hanger-86986409.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf the bottoms of your favorite jeans are permanently stained or worn beyond repair, consider making shorts. The best denims to choose from should fit comfortably in the hips, butt and thighs. Remember that baggy jeans will just become baggy shorts, and tight jeans will be still be tight shorts. Stretch jeans are not the best candidates to turn into shorts since they have rubber sew in the material. Decide what length you want:\r\n\r\n- Capris length are cut off right at the calf, and look great with heels or sandals.\r\n- Bermuda shorts hit at or right above the knee. Depending on the type of jeans being used, this style can be very comfortable or incredibly stylish.\r\n- Classic shorts typically hit 3 to 5 inches above the knee. This versatile style can be dressed up or down.\r\n- Short shorts have a hemline between 2 to 3 inches. This style is great for the beach, especially when worn with a cute bikini top.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to cut jeans to the proper length, sew a hem if desired to prevent excess fraying, and then embellish them with lace or studs if you want. When cutting jeans, use fabric scissors.\r\n\r\nNote: denims will get shorter as they fray. So if you want a line of fringe, the spot you mark for the cut should be about an inch below the length you want the finished shorts to be.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nSears has a rich history as one America’s oldest department stores, and its low prices and quality items have been a part of the store since the beginning. Although some Sears locations are criticized for their worn down and old appearance, the store is still beloved by many customers, including bargain hunters.\r\n\r\nDealspotr has put together the following list of ways to save at [Sears](https://dealspotr.com/sears). In no time you’ll be a savvy Sears shopper on the hunt for lots of good deals.\r\n\r\n**Join Shop Your Way**\r\n\r\nIt had a bit of a shaky start after it was launched in 2009, but now the Shop Your Way Rewards Program has worked out the kinks to provide great benefits to customers. The free program is easy to join and gives each person a membership number that must be used to cash in on membership perks. Shop Your Way members also get a free 90-day trial of Shop Your Way MAX, a paid subscription that is similar to Amazon Prime and offers free two-day shipping on most items. After finishing your free trial, you’ll have the option to continue the MAX program for $39 a year. If you don’t enroll in the paid program, your credit card won’t be automatically charged.\r\n\r\nShop Your Way has a lot of components and can be tricky to figure out at first. With a little practice, you’ll soon be able to take advantage of the many rewards.\r\n\r\nShop Your Way has more than 150 online partners, including most major retailers. Whenever you shop online at participating stores, you’ll earn points that are applied to your Shop Your Way account, but in order to do that, you must first log into ShopYourWay.com and click the link to your desired store from a list of online partners. Click the “Shop Now” button on the store’s page to track your spending and your points. Each store rewards a different amount of points, but that information is displayed on their Shop Your Way page. Shop Your Way occasionally offers special deals where they will double the points you get at each store.\r\n\r\nYou can also earn points by signing up for a credit or debit card with Shop Your Way. In fact, some stores will only reward points to Shop Your Way members with an enrolled credit card. Many of these stores are restaurants, which also allow points to be used in store instead of just online.\r\n\r\nThe Shop Your Way site also lets you shop for items based on product category. To do so, click the Departments tab, or search by brands using the Shop tab. Both search options can help you earn extra points, often in large quantities.\r\n\r\nAs an extra feature, Shop Your Way also features a Surprise Points section, where it randomly gives points that can be redeemed at nearly any participating store. There isn’t a rhyme or reason to these points, so check back regularly to see what’s in your account. Surprise points often have conditions applied to them that they may only work on a certain type of product or brand, have a quick expiration date, or require you spend a certain amount of money.\r\n\r\nShop Your Way rewards points can be redeemed very easily. Simply shop at Sears, Kmart, LandsEnd, or Mygofer in store or online and apply your points to your purchase by using your membership number at checkout. Every 1,000 points you earn transition to $1 that can be used on future purchases.\r\n\r\n**Coupons**\r\n\r\nIf the Shop Your Way points weren’t enough, there’s also a whole section of digital coupons. These coupons can easily be added to your Shop Your Way account and are automatically applied when you use your membership number at checkout. Coupons range from store-wide discounts like $10 off at Sears or can be limited to certain areas of the store or certain types of products, like a discount of $5 on a $50 clothing purchase or $25 off a major home appliance over $499.\r\n\r\n**Flash Sales**\r\n\r\nAs yet another added bonus for Shop Your Way members, the program also features flash sales under the Deals tab on its website. The deals are run either by Sears or Kmart or by Groupon, who is a Shop Your Way partner. The “Deal Heist” feature showcases limited-time deals from outside websites on products ranging from furniture and jewelry to tools and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Extra Features**\r\n\r\nAside from the points, coupons, and sales, Shop Your Way also provides a lot of social and gaming features that are designed to be interactive and give you more opportunities to save. The best way to see what is out there is to explore the site yourself and see the available features and what works best with your shopping habits and needs. There is also a sweepstakes area that allows you to enter to win points or even cars for free, as well as VIP program that has extra perks.\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful features on Shop Your Way is the catalog area, where you can organize and track items you may want to purchase in the future. Using this feature allows you to monitor prices and know when items go on sale.\r\n\r\n**Use Coupons and Promo Codes**\r\n\r\nEven without the Shop Your Way Rewards Program, Sears still regularly releases site-wide and high value promo codes and coupons. The promotions might occasionally be higher for Shop Your Way members, but they still provide everyone with great discounts. As with many other department stores, coupons and promo codes at Sears tend to come with a long list of exclusions.\r\n\r\nSears typically doesn’t allow coupon stacking, so it is rare that a promo code or coupon can be used with clearance items. Other exclusions include luxury brands and specialty items. Even with the exclusions, the frequency and value of coupons make them a great way for shoppers to get great deals.\r\n\r\nCheck back with often with Dealspotr.com to find the best available online coupon codes for Sears. Sears also sends coupons in the mail or in newspaper or regional publication inserts.\r\n\r\n**Shop Clearance Sales and Save up to 75%**\r\n\r\nAside from the typical department store offerings of clothes, furniture, and electronics, Sears sets itself apart with a large and extensive tool sections and an appliance section full of the best brands. These sections are so large that many other competitors can’t even come close with price and selection. Sears uses a lot of its store and warehouse space to store all of these products, including larger items like lawn mowers and refrigerators. Carrying so many large items means Sears is especially conscious about getting rid of excess inventory, which is where clearance sales come in. Sears runs large clearance sales on a regular basis to get rid of old and overstock items and to give the store room to restock and replenish its inventory.\r\n\r\nThe best deals in the store are often found in the clearance section, which makes it the best area in the store to start your shopping. Because Sears has so many items on sale and clearance at any given moment, you should only look at regular-priced merchandise if you can’t find what you are looking for in the clearance section.\r\n\r\n**Download the Sears App**\r\n\r\nAlthough it’s not as flashy at other apps, the Sears app is very useful. The app allows you to compare products by features, price, and user reviews, and also to read the Consumer Reports note about the product. You can also chat directly with brand representatives to ask them questions, which is especially useful when purchasing appliances.\r\n\r\nSears goes even further by notifying app users of sales and coupons as soon as they are available. You can also look at local flyers and use the app to order items and pick them up free in store to avoid paying shipping fees. A unique feature of the app is that it lets you notify the store once you have arrived to pick up an item, and store employees will then bring the item straight to your car.\r\n\r\n**Get a Sears Credit Card**\r\n\r\nIf you are a regular Sears shopper, a store credit card could be a good decision. Most departments in Sears offer a discount to cardholders, typically an extra 5% off, which can add up to huge savings on big items like furniture, appliances, or exercise equipment.\r\n\r\nEven better than the discount is that there are no interest options. You can purchase expensive items for yourself and your home as long as you pay the bill in full within 12 months and don’t have any late payments. Not having interest is a huge saving and a big advantage over other credit cards. Be sure to check the most recent terms and conditions before signing up for a card, as they can change at any time. You should also make sure your chosen offer is applicable to online purchases because some are only available in store.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nis something that you should guard with your life due to the negative consequences of having a bad credit score. This is a three-digit number that can affect you in many facets of life such as a applying for loan, mortgage or car approval. It can also play a part in whether you’re allowed to rent in certain places as well as your chances of getting certain jobs. If you’ve racked up a good amount of credit, you may think that the game’s over and that there’s nothing you can do. In this post, we’ll take a look at practical ways of raising your credit score back up to a respectable level.\r\n\r\n## Dispute and Ask for Adjustments\r\n\r\nYour bank, credit lenders and credit bureaus aren’t perfect. At the same time, they have a human side and are more likely going to want to have you as a client for a long time. With this knowledge, you should look at your credit report and report as well as dispute any discrepancies. In addition, you should consider talking to your preferred credit card bureau and ask them to write off certain debts such as those you may have incurred due to a one-time emergency. They are more likely to say yes, although this may still stay on your record, attracting much higher interest rates in the future.\r\n\r\n## Start Paying Everything on Time\r\n\r\n[Delinquency is one of the major causes of a bad credit score](https://www.credit.com/credit-reports/late-payment-secrets-revealed/). Each late payment is taken into account, creating a credit score that threatens to plummet back down to the 300’s. Commit yourself to start paying your bills on time as this wills slowly start raising your credit back up to a respectable level. Consider automating payments since this will ensure you never miss a payment.\r\n\r\n## Don’t Cancel Your Credit Cards\r\n\r\nA lot of people might instinctually reach for the scissors and cut up their credit cards in a last-ditch effort to save their sinking scores. This is counter-intuitive since you need credit cards to build up creditworthiness.\r\n\r\n## Move around Your Credit Card Balances\r\n\r\nIdeally, you should make sure that you don’t have more than 30 percent of your credit limit to debt ratio on each card. You should endeavor to move your balances around in order to reach this goal, and consider opening a new card that you can use as a base card to help you balance everything should you not have a decent balance on your existing cards.\r\n\r\n## Be Careful With Card Use\r\n\r\nA lot of people can’t help themselves in the face of credit. If your credit score is in the red, consider only using your cards 30 percent of the time and paying your way using cash or debit cards. If you can, go even lower at 10 percent since this value is what will raise your FICO score the fastest.\r\n\r\nA bad credit score doesn’t have to be the bane of your existence. With these quick and easy tips, you’ll be able to rebuild your score in no time and keep it at an acceptable level.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nBanks have gotten a bad rap over the last 7 years, due in part to [the 2008 financial crisis](https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1484264/The-Financial-Crisis-of-2008-Year-In-Review-2008). As a result, a lot of people are looking to alternatives, with credit unions being one of these. Pound for pound, credit unions seem to provide individuals with attractive incentives such as lower banking fees and higher rates. In addition, it’s estimated that there are more than 7,000 credit unions all over the country, serving millions of Americans. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of credit unions in comparison to traditional banks.\r\n\r\n## Banking Fees\r\n\r\nA lot of us grudgingly accept to pay overdraft, checking and other types of fees that banks levy on us. We rationalize these payments, saying that the bank has to make money since it’s a for-profit institution and that it offers us unmatched convenience. However, credit unions have traditionally been known not to charge fees. This is because they tend to be smaller than banks, which essentially means that they keep their overhead costs low. These savings are then passed on to customers in the form of no transaction fees charged. It’s also estimated that more than 70 percent of all credit unions offer no-fee checking, while only about a third of banks do so. In this case, credit unions are a clear winner when it comes to all things fees.\r\n\r\n## Interest Rates\r\n\r\nBanks offer competitive interest rates to encourage us to save. However, their rates don’t come anywhere close to what credit unions offer. That being said, credit union interest rates have been traditionally known to offer lackluster rates that don’t do your money justice on a year-to-year basis. Expect a rate of about 0.14% for credit unions and 0.13% for banks.\r\n\r\n## Customer Service\r\n\r\nGood service is at the heart of every successful banking service. People want to feel that their requests and needs are heard and attended to on a regular basis. Most banks usually cater to tens of thousands of clients which effectively stretches out their resources. You are unlikely to get a listening ear promptly if you decide to go the bank way. Credit unions, however, are the exact opposite given their size. This may change in the future, with banks scaling up their support systems in response to demand. That being said, credit unions take the cup when it comes to customer service for now.\r\n\r\nWhile we would like to advocate that [you consider credit unions](https://www.mycreditunion.gov/about-credit-unions/Pages/default.aspx), please be aware that you have to meet a certain eligibility criteria before being allowed to open an account with them. Some of these qualifications include having a certain form of employment, belonging to a specific religion or cultural affiliation or residential area. Make sure to ask exhaustive questions and check for any flexibility with regard to your choice of credit union so you can get in on the action. At the end of the day, carrying out adequate research and looking at your needs in their entirety will help you make the best decision going forward\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nGoing through life with sound financial backing is becoming more of a challenge for most people. After the 2008 economic crash, a lot of us realized that we were not taking note of our finances and plan for costs as we should. As a result, many Americans decided that things needed to change from a personal standpoint if we were going to have any semblance of a good retirement after decades of hard working. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the vital financial decisions you’ll need to make during key stages of your life.\r\n\r\n## Paying off Debt\r\n\r\nThe average [American student loan debt stands at $29,400](https://money.cnn.com/2013/12/04/pf/college/student-loan-debt/), give or take a few hundred dollars. This, coupled with credit card debt can make you start life on the wrong footing. Debt can hold you back both psychologically and financially, so it’s important to cut it down as soon as possible. Start by allocating a certain amount of your monthly income to debt payment. In addition, consider opening up various accounts where you can stash money that will go into paying the different types of debt you have. If you feel overwhelmed and don’t think you can do it on your own, look into debt consolidation agencies as well as debt counseling. Once you get out of debt, make sure to adopt good financial hygiene such as saving more than 10 percent of your income and choosing cards with a lower APR and cash back rewards to help you stay out of debt.\r\n\r\n## Buying a Home\r\n\r\nIf you’ve always wanted to own a home because of the example you were shown by your parents (they most likely took out a mortgage that they paid off for more than two decades of their life), think twice. This is because it has been shown that owning a home may not be a sound financial decision since market forces can hit you when you least expect it, effectively erasing all your financial gains. [Opt to rent or lease](https://realestate.aol.com/blog/2014/11/13/when-renting-is-better-than-buying/) to minimize your risk.\r\n\r\n## Starting a Family\r\n\r\nChildren are a boon to any couple given their contribution to the quality of life that they provide. That being said, having children may set you back financially in the long run. On average, it costs families anywhere from $13,000 to $15,000 to raise a child annually. College costs are also rising and are expected to hit the $300,000 mark by 2033. This is a huge investment that should be carefully considered by parents who are considering having themselves a comfortable retirement.\r\n\r\n## Healthcare\r\n\r\nAs we age, our bodies start showing signs of wear and tear. This could be in the form of illnesses that may need short or long-term care. If you would like to live a quality life without having to contend with the cost of treatment, you may want to put money into a savings account earlier in life. Insurance is great, but it hardly covers most conditions that are common in old age.\r\n\r\nThese tips, along with living within your means and investing and saving can go a long way in ensuring that you have enough money to go through life effortlessly.\r\n"

That said, they are a necessity for some parents who have busy schedules but wouldn’t think of leaving their children with someone who they don’t trust or isn’t accountable.

In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the ways for saving on childcare costs.\r\n\r\n## Ask a Family Member to Help Out\r\n\r\nGrandmothers and grandfathers relish in the opportunity to bond with other family members. By enlisting their help, you get to kill two birds with one stone: you’re able to have your children taken care of as well as help the two bond. In exchange, you might want to offer to foot their fuel or transportation costs or even offer free lunch and dinner as an extra incentive.\r\n\r\n[![](/posts/1080x1080_psoriasis_scalpcream.jpg)](/posts/1080x1080_psoriasis_scalpcream.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Look Into Daycare Centers that Receive Grants\r\n\r\nDaycare centers, especially those that are in big cities [receive grants from the government](https://www.mcf.gov.bc.ca/childcare/operating.htm) meant to improve service delivery. As a result of these grants, these centers are able to keep their costs low, making them a much cheaper option. If you have a choice of government-funded daycare centers to choose from, make sure to check out their policies on things like sick days so you know whether your child is also eligible for free care should they fall sick.\r\n\r\n## Form or Join a Mommy Association in Your Neighborhood\r\n\r\nNeighborhoods across the nation have come up with ways of getting their children the care they need without having to pay an arm and a leg for this. Mommy associations designate certain days to different individuals who take turns taking care of a bunch of kids. This is a much safer and virtually free way of providing care to children while at the same time getting to know your community members in a holistic way.\r\n\r\n## Saving On Childcare By Bartering Your Services\r\n\r\nIf you have a skill that you think will benefit a child care center, offer to provide it to them in exchange for free or discounted child care. Great examples include accounting skills to help balance the daycare’s books or offering to provide the center with free advertising for a set amount of time. This is a win-win situation for all parties involved.\r\n\r\n## Flex Scheduling or Working from Home are Options\r\n\r\nIf you absolutely feel like you and your child would benefit from constant care, you might want to ask your boss if it’s possible for you to come in much later and still work the mandated eight hours. Alternatively, you can [work from home and telecommute](https://www.workflexibility.org/5-benefits-of-telecommuting-for-employers-and-employees/), giving you all the time in the world to care for your child as you work.\r\n\r\n## Sign Up for Offers\r\n\r\nIf money is tight and you’d still like to keep your child at a certain standard, you might want to look into cutting coupons as well as signing up for offers online. The free stuff you get puts extra cash in your pocket, money that could go to other more important things such as setting up a college fund for your child. We hope these tips have opened you up to some easy ways you can lower your child care bill with little to no effort.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nThere’s a stigma that’s attached to being frugal. This is especially true in areas such as the workplace where gossip is rife and reputations are on the line. That being said, it’s important to note that frugality isn’t something that you should be ashamed of. At the same time, it’s possible to be frugal without being perceived as being a tightwad or mean. In this post, we’ll give you some simple tips to be frugal at work but still maintain a respectable and decent exterior to your peers.\r\n\r\n## Carpooling Always Wins\r\n\r\nIf you always drive to work, you’re most likely using up a big chunk on your money on fuel as well as car maintenance, possible parking and toll tickets as well as contributing to the growing carbon footprint. [Carpooling is a no-brainer](https://planetsave.com/2012/11/08/five-unexpected-benefits-of-carpooling-how-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint/), and it reduces the stress of having to drive to work on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n## Look out for Specials\r\n\r\nRestaurants have specials at lunchtime in particular. These meals are usually marked down with regard to price, and you can get to eat something different every day of the week if you order the special. This keeps your lunch costs down as well as sends your taste buds on a culinary adventure.\r\n\r\n## Use Coupons and Loyalty Cards\r\n\r\nIf you work close to places that give out [loyalty cards](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/31/are-loyalty-cards-really-worth-it), ask for one and become a regular. This way, you get to accrue points as you eat as well as get discounts on your meals. In addition, you can cut out coupons and present these to restaurants that accept them for even more savings.\r\n\r\n## Order a Shared Meal\r\n\r\nIf you have a friend who’s also into frugal living, join forces with them and ask to share meals with them if possible. These types of meals are especially popular in ethnic restaurants such as those that make Persian, Arabic, Indian or Polish cuisine. These meals not only tend to be cheap, but they are also delicious.\r\n\r\n## Limit Coffee and Cigarette Breaks\r\n\r\nCoffee can be expensive in the long run since it adds up over a large period of time. While coffee breaks are times when you are able to socialize with other people, they are not a necessity and may even land you in trouble with your superiors. Pick a few close friends and ask them out for a drink after work every so often, and ask them to share the costs of the outing beforehand. This way, you still get to socialize but save money.\r\n\r\n## Take Advantage of the Office Resources\r\n\r\nIf you’re lucky enough to work for a swanky company that has a gym, pool and other amenities, you may want to cancel your gym membership and use the office resources to squeeze in a workout. You may also want to consider taking a hot shower and carrying an extra set of clothes that you can wear after work to cut down on the number of showers you take at home.\r\n\r\nThere are so many opportunities to save money at work. Ultimately, it all depends on a bit of inventive thinking and using what’s around you to make the best of every situation.\r\n"

They are often seen on TV ads, heard over the radio or in print media promising heaven when it comes to getting rid of your debt. While this may all sound fine and dandy, these companies have a hidden underbelly that only those who have dealt with them know about. Being debt free brings with it feelings of joy and relief; however, when dealing with a debt settlement company, this relief may morph into dread and regret a few years down the line. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the reasons why a debt settlement service isn’t always the best idea.\r\n\r\n## How Debt Settlement Companies Work\r\n\r\nDebt settlement companies reduce your debt by contacting your creditors on your behalf in order to negotiate with them to get your payments or interest rates lowered. That being said, there’s a catch, and that is their commission. For example, they may get one of your credit card providers to lower your debt by a hundred bucks every month. However, you’ll have to pay the settlement company a commission which will eventually take a chunk off the hundred bucks you would have saved.\r\n\r\n## Credit Settlement and Your FICO Score\r\n\r\nIn addition, debt settlement companies may severely hurt [your FICO score](https://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/creditscores.aspx) in the long run. By convincing creditors to forgive your debt, your FICO score may plummet since creditors will pass on this information to the major credit bureaus who take into account how a debt was paid off. Most of these debts are usually marked as ‘settled for less than agree’ which will show up in your credit report, subsequently putting a dent on your record for as long as 7 years.\r\n\r\n## Inflated Interest Rates\r\n\r\nDebt settlement companies are motivated by self-interest. These companies also do not see way into the future, and may not disclose to you what’s going to happen to you half a decade from now. The truth is that using their services can cause creditors to hike up your interest rates. It’s not uncommon for settlement companies to ask that your payments be spread out for a number of years. This effectively means that you’ll have to pay more money in the long run due to the accrued interest rates over time.\r\n\r\n## It all Starts With You\r\n\r\nA lot of people think of debt settlement companies as Christ figures or saviors. However, the truth always lies in the fact that not a lot of us are willing to rein in our spending habits in order to get out of the vicious cycle of debt settlement once and for all. If you find that you’re always in debt, it may be a better idea for you to [seek out the services of a credit counselor](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0153-choosing-credit-counselor) who may provide you with tools to help you keep your spending in check so you don’t have to go to settlement companies. In addition, credit counselors are usually belong to non-profit entities whose goal is to see people out of debt, making their motives clean and almost noble.\r\n\r\nBefore calling that debt settlement company, look to alternatives that may work in the long-run to help you make behavioral changes that will go a long way in reining in your spending going forward.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nFor most students, the time before starting college is a carefree one with regard to finances. Parents foot bills without questions asked and give them a hefty allowance. Life is good, and there are no consequences if they decide to go all out with their credit cards. Upon joining college, the song changes due to the various responsibilities and life lessons these students must learn fast if they are going to survive in the real world. Making sound financial decisions while in college can put you on a head start when you finally graduate. In this post, we’ll take a look at a few financial tips every college student should apply for sound financial health.\r\n\r\n## Take Advantage of Student Discounts\r\n\r\nCompanies all over the country realize that students make up a sizeable majority of the people seeking out their services. Because of this, they have come up with incentives to boost loyalty and keep students spending. Student discounts can be a great way of having essentials subsidized. This may include transport costs, clothing, electronics and phone plans that target students. [Do some basic research into the available student discounts](https://www.bestcollegesonline.com/blog/2012/12/11/100-stores-that-give-a-student-discount/) and ask your friends to recommend some to you.\r\n\r\n## Use the Foolproof Envelope System\r\n\r\nThe envelope system entails putting away money meant for different expenses in different envelopes that are clearly marked. This way, you get to train your brain to use only what you have in a particular envelope for up to a period of a month or more. In order to find out how much you will need for a particular expense, work out a daily average and then allocate funds to the expense. For instance, if lunch costs you $7 a day, take this value and multiply it by 30 to come up with your monthly expenditure. If by any chance you exhaust the amount of money meant for a particular expense, do not be tempted to take money from other envelopes. If done long enough, you’ll be able to discipline yourself and use money in a more prudent manner.\r\n\r\n## Choose a Student-Centric Bank\r\n\r\nMany students make the mistake of going with the first bank appealing to their need for convenience or a certain lifestyle. While this may be a doozy, you’d be best served by a bank that has packages especially designed for student life.\r\n\r\nLook for banks which provide the following services:\r\n\r\n- No monthly or yearly charges\r\n- ATM fee reimbursement if you use an ATM that’s out of their network\r\n- A bank that features investment accounts\r\n- A bank that has an online bill pay feature\r\n- Person-to person payments\r\n\r\n## Use Credit Responsibly\r\n\r\nIt’s tempting to apply for the maximum allowed student loan because you can’t wait to live the high life in college. Doing so only starts you off with [a huge burden in life after graduation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2014/09/24/the-long-term-impact-of-student-loan-debt-on-universities/) since you’ll have to pay that money back. Base your loan application on the kind of job and commensurate salary you’ll be getting after graduation. Avoid spending your loan money on trivial items that won’t add value to your life such as buying round of drinks for your friends or getting the latest clothes.\r\n\r\nLastly, be wary of credit card representatives around campus who may try to get you to sign up for cards that have ridiculous interest fees. As a rule of thumb, always read the fine print if you decide to get one of these.\r\n\r\nBy employing these sound financial tips, you’ll be well on your way to creating good money karma in and after college.\r\n"

However, campuses usually are treasure troves for students who are willing to be proactive when it comes to getting a job that’s both convenient and pays a decent amount of money.

      "content": "\r\nWorking from home can seem like a dream come true for most people. The reality, however, is very different. If you aren’t disciplined, you are more likely to be less productive and get caught up in a number of health and social issues that a lot of us take for granted. This post examines some of the important things to help you turn your work-from-home dreams into a practical reality.\r\n\r\n## Set Aside a Designated Work Area\r\n\r\nA lot of us would like to believe that we’d be just as productive working in bed hunched over our laptops. While this may sound cozy and ideal, it may lead to back problems down the line such as scoliosis as well as muscle aches and cramps in no time. Create a section in a room in your house and put your desk, chair and laptop in this area and make sure to stick to it. Don’t be tempted to take your laptop with you to your bedroom for just one hour since this will eventually set you down a slippery slope of bad work hygiene. A great reason why you should set aside a work station is that [you can claim tax deductions on it according to the IRS](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/taxes/T054-C000-S002-a-tax-break-for-telecommuters.html).\r\n\r\n## Schedule Social Time\r\n\r\nWorking from home may be ideal for introverts who may not have the need to interact regularly with other people. However, if you’re somewhere in the middle or are extraverted but still want to telecommute, you may want to pencil in one or two lunch dates with friends to catch up on office cooler gossip or simply check in on how your friends are doing. In addition, since working from home provides you with work flexibility, you may want to consider going out more and trying out different activities that you’ve been meaning to get into in the past such as visiting museums, trips to the farmer’s market or simply joining a 1 hour a day Bikram Yoga class.\r\n\r\n## Pay Attention to Your Finances\r\n\r\nIndividuals who work from home may have some spare cash at the end of the month compared to those that have to work in an office. This is usually because you won’t have to worry about commuting costs as well as how much that office lunch cost an arm and a leg. In addition, you may be able to do extra work on the side such as being a virtual assistant or consultant, all of which bring in extra income. It’s prudent to get yourself a good CPA who can look at your books and recommend what to do with the extra cash as well as other ways of saving money.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can use various online tools such as:\r\n\r\n- [Mint](https://www.mint.com/)\r\n- [Budget Tracker](https://secure.budgettracker.com/login.php?sp=nouser)\r\n- [MoneyStrands](https://money.strands.com/)\r\n\r\n## Take Time Out to Exercise and Replenish\r\n\r\nWorking from home can be demanding on the body. Sitting for long periods of time can cause you all sorts of aches and pain. It’s a good idea to [take up yoga](https://www.ekhartyoga.com/) or low impact exercise such as walking once or twice a day if you can hack it. By keeping yourself in top condition, you’ll be able to be more productive and enjoy the whole work-from home experience.\r\n\r\nWith a bit of discipline, flexibility and focus, you can turn a telecommute situation into something that you can do for years to come.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nTrading in foreign currencies used to be the reserve of large companies as well as something most of us did in the past when we traveled to a foreign country that has a different legal tender. These days, currency or Forex trading is something millions of people all over the world do thanks in part due to the advent of the internet. However, it is estimated that more than 96% percent of Forex traders lose money, making it seem like an insider gig. In this post, we’ll provide you with actionable tips that you can use to trade in foreign currencies while mitigating your losses.\r\n\r\nForex trading usually deals with speculation. This basically means that the average trader will place bet and guess whether a certain currency pair will profit on the side of one currency. =\r\n\r\n## Common Currency Pairs:\r\n\r\n- EUR/USD\r\n- USD/JPY\r\n- GBP/USD\r\n- USD/CAD\r\n\r\nWhen trading these pairs, you are provided with leverage, making it possible to hold on to large amounts of cash in the Forex markets even with a low investment amount. For example, a 50:1 leverage on an initial investment amount of $1,000 means that you get to control $50,000 in the markets.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why failure rates in Forex markets are so high is because [a lot of people trade emotionally](https://optionalpha.com/the-14-stages-of-investor-emotions-and-trading-psychology-10433.html). Fear, greed and hope are some of the most destructive emotions during trading that need to be checked. Emotional-based trading decisions don’t take into account historical data on certain currency pairs, what the trading signals are currently alluding to and the fact that a negative value may only be transient and could mask an upward trend just around the corner.\r\n\r\n**Here are a number of great ways that can help you keep your emotions in check while trading foreign currencies:**\r\n\r\n- Study the market\r\n- Learn from your trading mistakes\r\n- Be honest with yourself\r\n- Institute stop loss signs to stop you from hemorrhaging money on a pair that’s nose-diving\r\n- Don’t listen to the mostly false claims of success from other traders\r\n- come up with a trading strategy you can stick to on a daily basis\r\n- consider subscribing to a Forex signals service to limit your risk and increase profit chances\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to get started on Forex trading, we would prefer that you start with a demo account which lets you speculate on Forex pairs without investing any real money. In addition, most online Forex brokers allow you to shadow successful traders for a fee, something that can help you learn from the best, cutting down your learning curve so you can get in on the action much faster.\r\n\r\n**Forex trading is also governed by two types of analysis that are used by traders all over the world:**\r\n\r\n- [Fundamental analysis](https://www.forex.com/forex-fundamental-analysis.html) – This involves studying the economic profiles of the countries whose pairs you are looking to trade.

      "content": "\r\nA lot of us have misconceptions about investing, with one of these being that you need to have a lot of money before even thinking about getting started. To be honest, even a dripping faucet can fill a bathtub. On account of this adage, you should consider investing and think of it as anyone’s game. If you have $100, there are various ventures you can get into which will allow you to make a lot of money in no time. Read on to find out what these easy tips are and how you should get started.\r\n\r\n## Buy Low, Sell High on eBay\r\n\r\nEBay is one of the world’s largest ecommerce stores that stocks a variety of goods, both new and pre-owned. If you have $100 to spare, [consider purchasing a few items and then reselling them on the website at a higher price](https://www.ebay.com/gds/How-to-make-money-on-Ebay-Buy-low-sell-high-/10000000002135997/g.html). Given the bidding feature of the site, you’ll always have someone who is more likely to buy what you have at a higher price. Keep at it and compound your profit by sinking it back into the business several times until you reach your goal\r\n\r\n## Open a Trading Account Without a Broker\r\n\r\nIn the past before the advent of the internet, people would have to physically go and see a broker in their office or call them on the telephone to discuss their trading options. Not only would this broker charge a fee, they would also not be entirely transparent when it came to what kinds of investments they made as well as profits garnered on behalf of the client. These days, all you have to do is check out the internet for hundreds, if not thousands of online trading platforms.\r\n\r\nTrading365.com and [IQOption.com](https://iqoption.com/) are two websites that allow you to invest as little as $10 to $100 in order to start trading. Make sure to trade small spreads and choose a longer timeframe to limit your risk if you’re a beginner. You can also sign up to receive reliable trading signals to further limit your risk as well as shadow one of the more successful traders. This kind of trading may need discipline, persistence and unemotional thinking if you’re going to be successful, qualities that may come with time if you don’t have them as part of your personality.\r\n\r\n## Start a Website and Earn Money\r\n\r\nIf you’re internet savvy, consider starting a website that will make you money in a passive fashion. In order to create a niche website, you must first identify a good niche, and make sure that there are little to no competitors doing the same. You’ll then need to choose a good name for your website and register it on a domain and hosting website such as hostgator.com. you can then decide to write about the niche yourself, or hire one or two writers. Once the website is up and running, you should expect to make an average of $1000 in 3 to 4 months if you picked a high demand and low competition niche.\r\n\r\nThere’s no such thing as a low amount when it comes to investing. A bit of creativity, persistence and discipline can go a long way in helping you turn $100 into thousands of dollars in no time.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nCredit cards are a modern staple given their convenience. They can come in handy when wanting to make instant payments without having to worry about exposing yourself to risk and fraud. They also provide you with a great way of boosting your credit score. In this post, we’ll cover some credit card basics you should know about or if you’re a first-time user or would like to adopt responsible credit card use.\r\n\r\n## Credit Card Annual Percentage Rate (APR)\r\n\r\n[The Annual Percentage rate (APR)](https://www.mybanktracker.com/credit-cards/basics/How-Is-Interest-Calculated/106354) gives you information on how much interest you’ll be charged annually. For instance, a credit card which charges an APR of 26.82% annually works out at 2.235% interest a month, which is typically higher than normal if compared to other credit cards issued by both banks and stores. However, you should be aware that the marketed APR tariffs are just guidelines and there’s room for negotiation should you need it. At the same time, if you have a poor credit score, you may get a higher APR or even be denied a credit card.\r\n\r\n## Credit Card Access and Approval\r\n\r\nThese days, banks take seriously the credit card approval process. Here is a list of individuals who may be denied a credit card:\r\n\r\n- Individuals with low credit scores\r\n- Someone who has a record of not paying off debts on time\r\n- Someone who regularly maxes out their credit cards\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to always be approved when you apply for credit card, make sure that you make your payments on time as well as use your cards responsibly. In most cases, poor credit card use may follow you for a period of 7 years, effectively locking you out of many benefits that come with owning a piece of plastic.\r\n\r\n## Transfer Fees – An Introduction\r\n\r\nA balance transfer fee applies when you transfer the balance from one credit card on another card. Certain credit cards offer a 0% balance transfer fee; that being said, this is only for a given amount of time, which is considered as a grace period. On the other hand, the money transfer fee refers to what you get charged should you want to move cash from your credit card to your bank account.\r\n\r\n## Credit Card Benefits\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at some of the reasons why you should consider paying using plastic instead of cash.\r\n\r\n- Using a credit card positively improves your credit score\r\n- A credit card may be priceless should you find yourself in an emergency\r\n- A credit card may allow you to earn rewards such as frequent flier miles and cash back rewards\r\n- A credit card is ideal if you tend to make a lot of online purchases\r\n- With a credit card, you qualify for payment protection should you have a problem with a transaction. Cards such as debit cards don’t have this feature.\r\n- With a credit card, you’re able to budget since you’re given a certain limit that you have to adhere to for a set period of time, mostly a month.\r\n\r\nUltimately, credit cards, if used well can transform the way you look at money as well as [your financial discipline](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T031-C023-S001-use-willpower-to-your-financial-advantage.html) as you go through life.\r\n"

You’ve just graduated [college](/way-too-easy-strategies-to-reduce-the-cost-of-college), and are looking to approach life with gusto and enthusiasm. This is all good and dandy, but the truth is that not having your financial priorities in check will have you reeling in shock as you go through one of the most important decades of your life due to poor money choices. In this post, we’ll take a look at a few financial commandments you should follow to the letter if you’d like to sail on, stress free, into your thirties.\r\n\r\n## Establish an Emergency Fund\r\n\r\nLife happens, and it does so without warning. The last thing you want to be is unprepared when you’re hit with some kind of en emergency. [An emergency fund](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/saving/T065-C000-S001-why-you-need-an-emergency-fund.html) can stop you from getting deeper into debt by giving you access to a large amount of cash should you need it. You should aim to save anywhere between the equivalent of 3 to 6 months of cumulative salary. This should be enough cash to cover your basics such as rent, food and utilities should you find yourself out of a job. Every time you receive your paycheck or any bonus amount, you should endeavor to save at least 10 percent into your fund. Make sure that it is a high yield easy access savings account for added convenience and savings potential.\r\n\r\n## Start Paying off Your Debt\r\n\r\nBy the time we’re done with college, a lot of us are saddled with debt to our necks. This is usually in the form of student loans as well as credit card debt. Not only does debt cloud our financial decision-making, it may also affect our ability to get certain types of jobs, get accommodation, qualify for mortgages or get approved for car loans. Attack your debt in a snowball fashion, and open up a bunch of account where you’ll be able to assign funds to different debt obligations. Pay off smaller debt amounts first and then move on to bigger ones since this will help motivate you to keep going until you’ve cleared the last of your debt. In addition, consider looking to hire a debt counselor if you find yourself overwhelmed in order to get a more informed view of how to move forward.\r\n\r\n## Insurance Can Go a Long Way\r\n\r\nYou might have been covered by your parent’s insurance when you were growing up, but as an adult, you shouldn’t count on your parents or even siblings to bail you out. Take out health, renters and home insurance to cover some of the most valuable things in your life: your health and your possessions.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, list all your expenses and [create a budget](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/credit/T007-C000-S001-how-to-create-a-budget.html) that you can stick to. By seeing where your money goes every month, you’ll have a clearer picture on how to stop any financial hemorrhaging by documenting and sticking to a plan for a month.\r\n\r\nAll these tips, if followed closely, can go a long way in ensuring that you make sound financial decisions in your twenties and beyond.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nA will is a legal document outlining how your assets will be shared amongst family and friends should you pass on. This is an important piece of paper that requires a lot of forethought and careful planning. Despite the fact that a lot of law experts recommend that you not write your own will without the help of someone who has a firm grasp of the law, you can do so if you have a general idea of what you’d like to say when it comes to your estate. In fact, some websites have prepaid wills that you can simply download and fill in with relevant information. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the basics of writing a will.\r\n\r\n## Top 4 Reasons to Write a Will:\r\n\r\n- If you are of frail health and don’t see yourself surviving for much longer\r\n- If you have a sizeable estate that you would like shared amongst family and friends\r\n- If you have a number of benefactors that you feel may contest your assets in your demise\r\n- If you have small children who you feel may have a hard time finding a voice in your death as it relates your estate.\r\n\r\n## Things that Must be Included:\r\n\r\n- Name the will’s executor so it’s not left up to guesswork\r\n- Be clear on how you’d like your debts and taxes paid\r\n- Make sure that pets are provided by giving them out to one of the people named in your will.\r\n- Provide guardian and trustee names if there are young children under 18.\r\n\r\n## A will can only be considered to be legal if:\r\n\r\n- The will is signed by yourself\r\n- Two witnesses sign the will\r\n- Have a notary sign an affidavit (this may only apply in some states and is not mandatory)\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the executor to appoint an attorney to probate the will in order for it to be made legal. In addition, it’s also OK to call two witnesses and tell them that ‘this is my will’ without having to disclose what’s in the document.\r\n\r\n## People involved in the will creation process:\r\n\r\n- Testator: This is you, or the person writing out the will\r\n- Trustee: An individual appointed by the testator or executor to manage will items if there are children under 18.\r\n- Executor: The person charged with the responsibility of carrying out your wishes as outlined in your will\r\n- Beneficiaries: Individuals named in the will who are set to receive your assets\r\n- Witnesses: Usually two individuals who are appointed to verify the signing of the will. They also sign the will themselves after witnessing the testator signing it.\r\n\r\nShould you die without creating your will, your assets and estate will go into intestate which typically means that the fate of your assets will be decided by state laws. To be on the safe side and make sure that your loved ones are catered for, prepare your will in advance and revise it every so often if you’d like.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nChecking accounts are a staple for millions of Americans across the country. They provide an unmatched convenience when it comes to making payments as well as deposits and withdrawals. That being said, there are a lot of pitfalls that many of us may not know about which could cost us hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. In this post, we’ll take a look at some quick and easy tips to help you make the best out of your checking account.\r\n\r\n## Take Advantage of a Debit Card\r\n\r\nChecking accounts usually come with an obligatory debit card that you can use in multiple locations[. A debit card is useful](https://www.quickenloans.com/blog/debit-cards-convenience-hassle) since you can only use it to spend money that you have, unlike a credit card. In addition, debit cards offer an extra layer of security since they can be blocked should you lose them. They are a great way of teaching yourself financial discipline since, unlike a credit card, you can’t make multiple purchases without leaving a dent on your finances.\r\n\r\n## Consider Setting up Automatic Payments\r\n\r\nWithdrawing money to pay for things like rent, utilities and eating out can cost you miniscule extra charges which snowball with time. For fixed, recurring payments such as rent, car payments, mortgages and water as well as electricity bills, setting up automatic payments will help you avoid these extra charges, saving you quite a bit over time.\r\n\r\n## Stick to Your Bank’s ATM’s\r\n\r\nATM’s are found all over the place these days. From the mall to the local 7-11, there’s always ready access to cash. Most times, these ATM’s may not be affiliated to your bank but may accept your card. Using these non-bank ATM’s means that you have to contend with extra fees. If you absolutely have to use non-bank ATM’s, make sure that your bank has a fee refund policy to help you minimize charges.\r\n\r\n## Link Your Checking Account to Your Savings Account\r\n\r\nA great way of ensuring that you’re on top of your finances is to link your savings and checking account. This feature allows you to shunt money from one account (preferably your checking account) to another conveniently. It also may inculcate a culture of saving which can go a long way in setting up a retirement, investment or emergency fund.\r\n\r\n## Get Overdraft Protection\r\n\r\nYou should always have some kind of protection that automatically lets you know if your account balance is in the red. This usually can be in the form of a text alert or email from the bank letting you know that you’re spending way over what you currently have in your account. [Overdraft protection puts stops and checks on your](https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2015/01/27/is-overdraft-protection-real-a-look-at-the-big-4-banks) account effectively safeguarding your balance.\r\n\r\nIf you’re more into convenience, consider asking that your bank provide you with online banking services. Online banking not only makes it easier for you to pay bills, they also make it possible for you to carry out online transactions securely. Ultimately, checking accounts, if used well, will provide you with a dearth of benefits that are within easy reach at all times.\r\n"

However, people who earn a low income may find this feat particularly difficult to achieve because of the money coming in every month. In fact, it’s not uncommon for you to live paycheck to paycheck if you’re on a low income. This usually leaves little to no money to tackle your debts in the way you’d like to. In this post, we’ll provide you with some easy and practical ways you can lower and eventually eliminate your debt no matter how low your income is.\r\n\r\n## Stop the Credit Card Madness\r\n\r\nCredit can be a great way of establishing a good financial picture especially with regard to your FICO score. [A healthy FICO score](https://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/creditscores.aspx) can play a role in important things such as applying and getting approved for various types of loans as well as things such as renting a house, buying a car and getting employed in various industries. That being said, the last thing you want to do is to keep digging if you’re in debt. Stop using your credit cards and switch to debit or cash and you’ll be able to turn off the overflowing tap that is your debt problems.\r\n\r\n## Categorize Your Debts and Create a Payment Plan\r\n\r\nAt any given time, most of us have different types of debts such as car payments, the mortgage, credit card debt, loans and more. That being said, these debts can be divided into two: secured and unsecured debt. Secured debts, for example, are backed up by collateral or security that you may lose if you ever defaulted on paying them (this is especially true of houses and cars). A great way of taking down these debts is to apply the snowball effect. This simply means putting a large amount money on the secured debts and then paying off the minimum on the others. Keep doing this, tackling the most important ones until they are paid off. This way, you make progress in a multifaceted manner, which will help you tackle your debt in a much faster way.\r\n\r\n## Reconsider Your Priorities\r\n\r\nHappiness can come from various things in life. That being said, we have been programmed to think that money is the only thing that brings happiness. This may have caused a lot of us to spend money on things that don’t matter in the quest to find happiness. The 5 Starbucks coffees a week, the magazine and cable subscriptions, expensive holidays, fancy gadgets all drag us deeper into debt.\r\n\r\nStart by cancelling all subscriptions that may not be a necessity, and consider purchasing food and house items in bulk. This can save you a lot of money in the long run since these essentials make up a large fraction of the average person’s monthly income. On top of that, [you can start couponing](https://www.frugallivingforlife.com/couponing-tips.html) to save big bucks as well as saving leftovers to eat later and planning meals before time to keep your food bill low. Spend more time with your family doing meaningful things, and you’ll realize that it’s not how much you spend that counts, it’s the experiences you have with your loved ones that does.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much you earn, these tips can be applied universally to help you get you out of debt in no time.\r\n"

In this post, we’ll take a look at the best ways to get you the best deals while using your student card.\r\n\r\n## Transportation\r\n\r\nIf you have a weekend to spare and would like to head out of campus and have some fun, you may want to take advantage of the various bus companies that accept and give out student cards. Not only is this a great way to save money, it is also an amazing way to see the country especially if you’re heading out with friends.\r\n\r\nSome of the bus companies that accept student discount cards include:\r\n\r\n- Greyhound\r\n- [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/student-discount)\r\n\r\n## Shopping\r\n\r\nLooking good and having the latest gadgets is something that almost every student aspires towards. However, these items usually cost an arm and a leg, and on a student budget, it’s virtually not possible to go to the mall and shop to your heart’s content. Luckily, some stores such as Apple and J Crew as well as others provide massive discounts to students as long as they are able to present their ID. A great inclusive card to have is the Student Advantage Card which has partnerships with retail giants such as Target, Lenovo, Foot Locker, and Karma Loop. Check it out [here](https://www.studentadvantage.com/discountcard/).\r\n\r\n## Shared Accommodation\r\n\r\nIf you feel that you’ve had enough of campus living and would like a larger place with more privacy, consider shacking up with a friend that you get along with. This will save you money on college accommodation costs as well as teach you a thing or two about independence and responsibility. If you’d like to get discounts on house items, check out the Wal-Mart money card found [here](https://www.walmartmoneycard.com/AcctMgmt/Controls/Walmart/Support/Products.aspx).\r\n\r\n## Cell Phone Discounts\r\n\r\nIf you’re a social butterfly but are worried about racking up a huge phone bill, contacting your carrier can make it possible for you to sign up for a plan that will save you money as well as get you the latest cell phone and related devices. Check out [this Sprint student discount plan](https://mysprint.sprint.com/verify/?ECID=vanity:verify) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Limit the Number of Credit Cards You Own\r\n\r\nCredit cards can be incredibly convenient. They can also help you build your FICO score, making it more likely for you to be approved for loans later in life. that being said, signing up for credit cards can put you in more debt since these cards usually come with astronomical interest charges which may take some time to pay off. Resist the temptation to take these cards, or limit yourself to only one.\r\n\r\nLastly, consider purchasing text books using your student discount card since these cost a fortune these days. Alternatively, look into buying used text books from students who have just taken the course and are looking to make some money from selling off their books.\r\n\r\nUltimately, looking around you for different resources available to you as well as asking the right questions can help you bust your budget during your college years effortlessly.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n[![frugality 1](/frugality-1.jpg)](/frugality-1.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe live in a society that judges your self-worth by how much you make and what you own. Status items such as big houses and cars are the order of the day all over the country, and the race to own these things is a never-ending one. Being frugal, on the other hand, is something looked down on by many people who attribute this kind of living to hippies and people who live on the fringes of society. That being said, there are numerous benefits of adopting a frugal lifestyle, and we’ll take a look at a few in this post.\r\n\r\n## Being Frugal Leads to Less Stress\r\n\r\nA lot of us are saddled with debt because we want to keep up with our peers and neighbors. The constant consumption and consumerism takes a toll on our pockets and it makes us want to own things just so we can fit in and look the part. This debt grows with each passing month and year, and we obsess over how we are going to pay back the thousands of dollars owned by us. Being frugal means buying only the necessities and foregoing anything that’s considered luxurious. We have little to no debt when we live like this, and this is something that can improve the quality of our lives since we don’t have the scepter of debt hanging over our heads.\r\n\r\n## Being Frugal Makes You Appreciate Things More\r\n\r\n[The endless cycle of consumption](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/amitai-etzioni/the-crisis-of-american-co_b_1855390.html) can make us seem like zombies that aren’t present in our daily lives. We make purchases for items we see on TV or read about in the magazines and sometimes only use these items once or twice. This perpetuates an attitude of taking things for granted. After a while, this cycle causes emptiness and sadness, and we ask ourselves why is it that we feel this way when we have so much. Being frugal teaches you to appreciate and take joy in the little things that we have, comfortable in the knowledge that these things have a sentimental value.\r\n\r\n## Being Frugal Frees Up Time\r\n\r\nOne of the benefits of frugality is that it doesn’t eat into your time since you don’t have a lot to take care of, attend to or repair. A big house may look good, but it needs cleaning every so often. A big 55 inch TV will provide you with stellar entertainment at the expense of spending time with your family. A good job comes with perks, but it requires crazy hours at the office. By learning to live with just enough, we free up time to indulge in the things that matter in life such as family, following one’s passions and helping other people as well as the community around us.\r\n\r\n## Frugality Is Good for The Environment\r\n\r\nA lot of the stuff we buy takes a huge toll on the environment. Gadgets drain energy from the grid, leading to a much larger carbon footprint. A lot of the products that we buy are made from natural resources that come from the earth which gets pillaged to make them. By being frugal, we are consciously [taking responsibility for our energy and resource use on the planet](https://www.wisebread.com/cheap-green-how-to-save-money-and-environment).\r\n\r\nBeing frugal can be challenging at first, but it can be done. The idea is to ease into it and evaluate what you can and can’t live without in order to make informed decisions.\r\n"

Whether it’s credit card debt, a mortgage or student loans, we all have something that’s holding us back financially, causing us untold misery and sometimes sleepless nights. Being in debt is no fun, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise when you feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders the moment you make that last payment to finally make you debt-free. However, existential angst may soon set in, leaving with questions that gnaw at you. What’s next after conquering debt? In this post, we’ll answer this question as well as give you tips to help you go forward in your new life.\r\n\r\n## Set Up an Emergency Fund\r\n\r\nLife has so many unpredictable moments that seem to hit you at the worst of times. From an accident necessitating a visit to the ER to a broken down car that needs serious downtime and repair at the mechanic and body shop, we’ve all been there at one time or another. By putting money into an emergency fund, you’ll always have a ready finance source that you can dip into to take care of these unforeseen events. Ideally, you should take your average monthly pay and multiply it by 6 to get a good value with regard to your emergency fund. However, this should be subjective, and you should determine how much you want to put into your nest egg depending on your financial habits. This money should be able to support you for at least half a year should something go awry with your job as well.\r\n\r\n## Consider Switching Careers or Getting a Better Job\r\n\r\nMost of us stay in jobs that we don’t particularly like because we have to pay the bills and believe that having a job is better than having none. While this may seem like a prudent thought, it may very well be the fastest way of getting back into debt. After you’ve cleared your debt, you’ll need to change your mindset as well as adopt an aspiration type of thinking. Challenge yourself to apply for new positions or take up a second job in an industry that you’re passionate in and motivates you. This way, you’ll grow professionally, get paid much more and learn the value of a dollar. In addition, don’t forget to put this new income stream to work by investing in stocks, bonds and futures or simply sinking it into your 401k.\r\n\r\n## Reward Yourself; You Deserve It!\r\n\r\nPositive reinforcement [is at the cornerstone of good human behavior](https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html). Clearing your debt should send you over the moon, and you should celebrate. Organize a party and call your friends over to celebrate your good news. Offer them tips on how they can do the same, and make the party both fun and educational. You’d be surprised at how many people are in your past situation and how a single word of encouragement can go a long way in helping them finally break free, just like you did.\r\n\r\nLife after debt presents so many opportunities that, if taken seriously, will go a long way in making sure that you never have to go back to your dreaded debt years.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n[Bad credit can affect your life in more ways than one](https://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/consequences-having-bad-credit/). Luckily, there are things you can do to help build up your credit such as signing up for a secured credit card. This is a simple card that requires you to put down a deposit that more often than not matches your credit limit on the card. Should you fail to make payments, this deposit is taken from a designated account and used to pay off what you owe to the card issuer. In this post, we’ll take a look at the top 5 best secured credit cards for 2018 as well as the unique selling point for each card.\r\n\r\n## The Wells Fargo Secured Credit Card\r\n\r\n[This is a card](https://www.wellsfargo.com/credit-cards/secured/) that offers low interest rates as well as the ability to keep up with your credit card use via email alerts. In order to get one, you’ll have to put down a minimum amount of $300 which is usually refundable as long as you don’t go into delinquency with regard to paying off your credit card payments and bills. It comes with an 18.9% APR which can be considered to be decent for most credit cards. With a low annual fee of $25 as well as a 25-day grace period, this is one card that gives other secured credit cards a run for their money. Lastly, you may be able to qualify for an unsecured credit card if you make your payments in time for up to a year.\r\n\r\n## The BankAmericard ® Secured Credit Card\r\n\r\nWe decided to feature [this card](https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/products/secured-credit-card.go) because it has a high grace period as well as low annual fee among other benefits. The APR on this card stands at 20.24% which isn’t exactly the best, but not the worst either. You don’t get charged a cent if you apply for this card, and you only pay an annual fee of $39. It comes with no monthly charges, and bundles travel accident insurance for those of us who find themselves on the road every other day. You will however be required to put down a $49 security deposit and $300 at the time of signing up and allows you to qualify for a real credit card should you make your payments on time. This, however, is at the discretion of the Bank of America, the card issuer.\r\n\r\n## The Capital One ® Secured Credit Card\r\n\r\n[This card is issued by Capital One Financial](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/secured-mastercard/), one of the most recognized and biggest banks in the country. You won’t get charged an application fee, and with a low yearly fee of just $29, it is obviously a winner. The bank also reports automatically to all three major credit bureaus once you start using the card which is essentially a good thing since it’s this kind of prompt reporting that will go a long way in rebuilding your credit score. Lastly, the card is served by a responsive 24 hour customer support team. Your credit line with the Capital One ® secured credit card ranges between $200 to $3,000, and comes with an incredible 50 cents interest charge.\r\n\r\nWhatever card you choose to pick, please be aware that these cards should be used to specifically build your credit score so you can reclaim the benefits of having a high score.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nIn today’s unpredictable investment climate, a lot of people are looking for something that will enable them to make money without the all-consuming risk associated with so many investments. Dividend stocks are preferred by many individuals both young and old due to their low risk premise as well as their propensity to compound over time. Read on to find out more about dividend stocks and how you can get in on the action.\r\n\r\n[Dividend stocks](https://www.nasdaq.com/dividend-stocks/) are made possible by profitable companies that reinvest their profit into paying company shareholders a certain amount of money on a regular basis. This makes dividend stocks a great idea for people in their twenties who would like a form of investment that pays them on a regular basis or if you’re looking to retire and want to have a steady income stream in your golden years.\r\n\r\nCompanies pay out dividends on a quarterly basis. This is mostly because companies announce their profit results on a quarterly cycle, or every three months. In order to get your share of the cake, you must be a shareholder and abide to the company’s regulations. In addition, companies must hold board meetings to decide on the amount of dividend stock to be paid as well as record minutes of the meeting in paper. When you get paid, you usually receive a dividend voucher which may be paper or an electronic note.\r\n\r\n**For your dividend voucher to be valid, it will need to have the following information:**\r\n\r\n- The name of the company\r\n- The date\r\n- The director’s signature\r\n- Your name and address\r\n- Total net dividend\r\n- Number of shares you own as a shareholder\r\n- Amount of tax credit\r\n\r\nAccording to [the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/), companies looking to pay out dividends should announce a date they would like to do so, also called a declaration date. In order for you to qualify for the payout, you will need to have purchased shares in the stock before this declaration date.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to payment, you may decide to receive a cash amount or reinvest the amount back into the account. While a lump sum cash amount may seem lucrative, you may want to think about putting the money back into the company since it will compound over a set period of time.\r\n\r\nIf you are thinking of purchasing dividends, consider researching your ideal company to make sure that they have a good track record. You may also want to stick to reliable firms that have been there for a long time since you’ll be assured of a regular and decent return on your investment. You may also want to consider using online screeners which do a good job at aggregating vital dividend-related indexes such as industry, market cap, payout, price, dividend yield, frequency and history. All these details can help you paint a good picture of where to invest your money.\r\n\r\nAs will all investments, consider diversifying your dividends to protect yourself against any volatility that may occur in the future. Here’s to your success!\r\n"

That said, there are ways you can shrink your tax bill if you make use of some of the allowances that Uncle Sam has given you that you may not know about. Read on to find out what this year’s tax tips are.\r\n\r\n## Close out Worthless Stock\r\n\r\nIf you have some stock lying around that’s not making you a profit, speak to your broker so you can come up with a deal to have him or her buy it from you. You can then use the loss to take care of any gains, tax-wise\r\n\r\n## Combine Business with Pleasure\r\n\r\nA great way of making sure that you’re not taxed to your ears is to squeeze in some holiday time during your next business trip. This could be in the form of two extra days of fun in the sun in Mexico on your way back from a London business meeting, or whatever floats your boat. This way, you can write off the holiday as a deduction, as long as you spent half the time away carrying out business-related matters.\r\n\r\n## Gambling Winnings Need to Be Reported\r\n\r\nIf you’re a Vegas veteran or like to hit up the casino at the mall every so often, you may want to think twice about not reporting your earnings. [Money from gambling winnings is taxable](https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/09/19/uncle-sam-wants-his-cut-on-your-gambling-winnings/), and should be reported. However, you should look at your gambling activity in its entirety so you can claim only have the winnings taxed and not the losses.\r\n\r\n## Look Into Fortifying Your Retirement Savings Account\r\n\r\nThe government looks kindly on individuals who put away money into their IRA’s and 401K’s. It does so by giving these individuals tax breaks that may not be available to ordinary savings and checking account holders. This is not only a great way to qualify for a tax break, but it is also a good way of saving money that will go into making sure you’re comfortable later on in life.\r\n\r\n## Job-Hunting Tax Deductions: Yes, You Read That Right\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been looking for a new or second, third of fourth, you can claim tax deductions on things like transportation costs, resume printing, on-the-road accommodation and more. The economy isn’t so good and the government is acknowledging this by giving job hunters a break.\r\n\r\n## Working From Home? This One’s For You\r\n\r\nIf you telecommute and use a room in your home as your office, you may want to consider claiming tax breaks on things such as office furniture. More and more people are choosing to work from home, and this kind of incentive exists to encourage even more people to make the telecommuting jump.\r\n\r\n## Energy-Related Tax Deductions\r\n\r\nIf you’ve jumped on the solar or wind energy bandwagon, we have good news for you; [the government is providing you with up to 30 percent savings](https://energy.gov/savings) when it comes to the total cost of your solar panel or or any other form of renewal energy generator.\r\n\r\nThese tips can help you offset your tax bill, leaving you with extra money that you can use to invest, or save for a rainy day.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nGoing off to college can be an exciting and apprehensive time for most students. On one part, we can’t help but be excited about the world that’s about to open to us on account of the different people we’ll meet and the experiences we’ll share, but there’s always that fear of the debt that we’ll rack up post-college. The truth is, with some sound financial tips, you won’t have to worry about the money drain that most students experience during the best years of their lives. In this post, we’ll provide you with quick and easy tips on how to save money as you go through college.\r\n\r\n## Opt for Cheap Entertainment Options\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to go to every concert in town in order to have fun or drink like it’s going out of style to get a good buzz and socialize with your friends. You could decide to [hold poker night](https://uk.askmen.com/money/how_to_150/163_how_to.html) every so often or plan a hike with a few close friends every weekend if you want. In addition, you could do movie nights and ask everyone to bring their own drinks and snacks. This way, you get to slash your entertainment bill without having to worry about missing out on some great college times.\r\n\r\n## Look Into Attending Community College\r\n\r\nIt’s important to realize that state colleges are expensive due to the perceived demand and quality of education that they provide. However, if you’re looking to cut costs, consider attending community college for the first two years. You’ll be able to take the same credits and then transfer them to a state college of your choice, effectively saving you money.\r\n\r\n## Ask for Student Discounts\r\n\r\nStudent discounts may not overtly be advertised by various stores and services. Because of this, you should always get into the habit of asking for store discounts. Sign up for offers and look online for more savings. As always, you should have your student card tucked in your purse or wallet since you may need this for verification and discount approval.\r\n\r\n## Look into Merit-Based Scholarships\r\n\r\nA lot of us have heard of sports-based scholarships. The truth is that only a very small percentage of individuals who apply for sports-based scholarships eventually qualify for them. If you want to boost your chances, you might want to make sure that your high school academic scores are above average since this is what will most likely garner you a scholarship position. Make sure to explore the different [merits in different subjects and activities](https://www.gocollege.com/financial-aid/scholarships/types/merit-scholarships.html) so you can expand your possibilities.\r\n\r\n## Bonus Tips\r\n\r\nOther simple and practical tips include commuting from home instead of staying in the dorms or hostels, and attending a college that gives discounts to alumni offspring. In addition, you don’t really have to purchase new textbooks because these tend to be expensive. Simply buy used ones from other students who just finished the course you’re enrolling in or check online and compare prices to get the best deal. Keeping your options open can go a long way in making sure you attend college without having to worry about your finances.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nA college education can be expensive. That being said, there are various incentives proposed by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators each year seeking to ease the burden of finance for both students and the parents who support them. In this post, we’ll take a look at the various plans available to you as well as the eligibility criteria you need to meet to be considered.\r\n\r\n## The American Opportunity Tax Credit\r\n\r\nThis is an incentive which takes into account the amount you spend on your first 4 years of college. It also provides you with the opportunity to get a partial refund in the form of a check from the IRS of up to 40 percent of your total expenditure during these 4 years.\r\n\r\n### In order to be considered, you must:\r\n\r\n- Have a [modified adjusted gross income](https://www.irs.com/articles/what-modified-adjusted-gross-income) of $90,000 as an individual or $180,000 for a joint couple.\r\n- As a student, you must have been enrolled at the very least half the time for one term during that academic year in the quest to get a degree, certificate or related credential.\r\n- You must be in an eligible school such as a public, accredited, proprietary, nonprofit or postsecondary institution\r\n- The incentive is only available during the first four years of undergraduate postsecondary education\r\n- File an income tax return\r\n- Not have been convicted of a felony for distribution or possession of a controlled substance.\r\n\r\n## The Lifetime Learning Tax Credit\r\n\r\nThis is available to all students, regardless of their postsecondary education. This credit is best suited to graduate students. The Lifetime Learning Tax Credit provides up to $2,000 per submitted tax return. Please note that you cannot get a refund on this type of incentive.\r\n\r\n### In order to be considered, you must:\r\n\r\n- Have a MAGI of less than $64,000 if you are an individual, or $128,000 if you are a couple.\r\n- File a federal tax return as well as have some type of tax liability\r\n- Not have claimed the American opportunity credit incentive.\r\n\r\nOne good thing about this kind of credit is that you can still be eligible even when you have been convicted on a drug felony charge.\r\n\r\n## Tuition and Fees Tax Deduction\r\n\r\nThis is a deduction that can reduce your taxable income by up to $4,000. In addition, this tax deduction is ideal for people who may have not qualified for the other two types of deductions we’ve mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n### Here are the requirements:\r\n\r\n- You must have a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of less than $80,000 or $160,000 if you are married and are filing jointly\r\n- You are advised to use the deductions to offset the cost of tuition and fees as well as miscellaneous things such as book purchases, supplies and equipment needed for learning.\r\n- These expenses should be for a student who is enrolled in one or more courses at a higher education institution that is eligible.\r\n- You should only claim this deduction if you are married and file taxes jointly\r\n- You may not claim a Tuition and Fees Deduction for the same student for the same year. However, you can divide these two between two students.\r\n\r\nWhatever tax credits you decide to take, always make sure to adhere to the rules in order to have your request processed without a hitch. For more information on tax credits, please check out [the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators website](https://www.nasfaa.org/).\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nOffice rent prices are always rising with each passing year. It is becoming increasingly hard for businesses to hire good talent while at the same time keep their overhead costs low. This is perhaps one of the major reasons why virtual offices have become mainstream over the last decade. Telecommuting, as it is also known is a great way of making sure that employees do the required work without having to worry about added costs such as rent and office furniture and supplies. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the advantages of having a virtual office compared to a brick-and-mortar one.\r\n\r\n## Saves Time\r\n\r\nVirtual offices can save a lot of time, freeing up this resource so it can be used towards more productive endeavors. People all around the world wake up on a daily basis to get ready to [head to work](https://blog.personalcapital.com/financial-planning-2/surprising-costs-commute/). They then head out the door, only to spend anywhere between half an hour to an hour in traffic. The same applies for the commute back in the evening. This usually means that the average worker may spend up to 3 hours every day getting ready and going to work and then coming back home. Individuals who have virtual offices don’t have to worry about any of this, making it more likely for them to be more productive.\r\n\r\n## Ideal for Certain Personalities\r\n\r\nVirtual offices are also ideal for certain personalities who would rather work alone. This is especially true of introverts and creatives as well as type ‘A’ personalities who may need the feeling of being in control in order to work in an efficient manner. At the same time, certain careers are better suited to a virtual workplace such as people who are in the media and writing industry, scientists, people in finance and those in management.\r\n\r\n## Hiring Great Talent is Easy\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that virtual offices don’t require individuals to be in one location, you as the business owner are free to hire people from other parts of the country and [internationally](https://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/monster-training/security-center/hiring-non-us-workers.aspx). This puts you in touch with exceptional talent for a much cheaper price, which in the end boosts your bottom line.\r\n\r\n## Good for the Environment\r\n\r\nVirtual offices have also been shown to be good for the environment. Given the little to no need for commuting or purchasing office supplies and other items that may be needed for a physical office, companies that are choosing to go virtual are helping preserve the environment by reducing their carbon footprints to negligible levels.\r\n\r\n## Flexibility\r\n\r\nVirtual offices also provide your employees with flexibility that may actually boost productivity. It has been shown that when people feel comfortable, they are more likely to be more motivated and give their best. The truth is that most employees do not need to be watched like hawks in order for them to be productive.\r\n\r\nWith a virtual office, you are also able to run multiple businesses as well as 24 hour businesses should you decide to hire people from all over the world. This means a bigger bottom line for you and faster growth in the end, taking your operation to new heights.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nA volatile market requires a bit of ingenuity. Naked puts arose because of the need for traders to make gains over a short period of time without having to overthink risk. By definition, naked puts are insurance against traded positions usually provided by a third party. These are vital for individuals who may speculate a fall in share prices and would like to sell, or those that are looking for some kind of buffer on account of the fact that they are holding a large number of shares that they would hate to lose in the event of a financial catastrophe.\r\n\r\nNaked puts usually help individuals profit when share or commodity prices are going down. This may seem counter-intuitive, since a lot of traders usually think that you should only buy high and sell low. Naked puts are ideal for high quality shares that you don’t mind having even when prices go down. This kind of thinking allows people make profits on weak shares as well as buy into stronger ones.\r\n\r\n## Key Points on Puts\r\n\r\n- Only write naked puts on quality stocks that have shown promise with regard to profits over the last couple of years.\r\n- Look for puts that have spreads that are $0.25 or lower since this will protect your investment should things start going south very fast.\r\n- Strike during uncertain times; this is because a lot of people will be dumping shares that may actually turn out to be profitable after the storm has passed\r\n- Pay attention to the 200-day moving average price for the stock you’d like to buy into, and make sure that it hasn’t dipped below this price.\r\n- Only trade over short time periods so you’re able to strike like a scalper which in effect limits your loss. Timing here is everything.\r\n- Have a stop-loss strategy, especially in a volatile market. Prudence also requires you to trade small volumes so you don’t make losses that are so big that you may have a problem bouncing back from later.\r\n\r\nIn order to trade naked options, you must borrow money from your broker. This money is also known as margin and is something that essentially reduces your risk since you’re not using your own money.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, investors who place money on naked puts usually don’t go at a loss even if the price of a certain stock improves after their put action because they will make money from the premiums that they will collect when worthless options expire. To put the whole naked put phenomenon in easy-to-understand terminology, you as a trader should always write calls when prices are moving down, and write sells when prices are going down. It is this opposite movement compared to what everyone else is doing that will bring in a profit every time.\r\n\r\nLastly, don’t forget to keep a level head at all times and do your homework into the different stocks you’d like to call before moving ahead since this will provide you with the facts you need to make informed decisions.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nExchange Traded Funds have been an investing staple for the last 20 years. What’s so great about them is that they offer the average trader incredible flexibility to trade on different indexes. That being said, they can be confusing and even overwhelming to the beginner ETF trader given the massive amount of choice they have; from oil, to gold, to silver and even agricultural and tech products, these are investment options that can work for you if you know what you’re doing.\r\n\r\nETF’s can be traded like stock, and they are regulated by three bodies, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard and [State Street Global Advisors](https://www.ssga.com/home.html). Before settling on a particular ETF, make sure to do adequate research by looking at how it has been performing over the last 5 to 10 years. This will give you a much clearer picture on whether your choice will provide you with long-term profitability. Armed with your research, you can look around for a broker.\r\n\r\nAn ETF broker should be registered with at least one regulatory body such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority found here. This will give you the peace of mind in knowing that you are picking someone who is answerable to a higher authority should anything go wrong with your investment.\r\n\r\n## Common ETF Types\r\n\r\n- Gold ETF’s\r\n- Commodity ETF’s such as coal, livestock and oil\r\n- Pharmaceutical ETF’s\r\n- Emerging market and foreign ETF’s\r\n\r\n[Make sure to diversify your portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/072303.asp) within reason so you can maximize profits. In addition, a great way to gain expertise in an industry is to invest in that industry’s ETF’s without getting your feet wet. A good example here is investing in livestock in Argentina without having to go to the ground and carrying out transactions with farmers. This can even be done online on trading sites that offer great prices for their ETF’s as well as signals to help you know when to put or call (sell or buy) on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis.\r\n\r\nETF’s also provide a place where investors can put away liquid cash until a time when they are ready to use it for other purposes. For example, if you have an extra $1,000 gotten as a tax refund, you could decide to purchase a few ETF’s and make your money grow over a short or long period of time.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why you should consider ETF’s is the accountability and transparency associated with these kinds of investments. This can be seen in the daily publishing of the types of assets available in ETF’s by brokerage companies on a daily basis. This is something that’s not seen when it comes to mutual funds and other investments who may publish asset details infrequently or unreliably.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to minimize risk, an ETF is your best bet as it helps you hedge risk. You can do so by deciding to sell a particular ETF in your portfolio. This can be used when the market is bearish, or when you would like to protect your position during certain market events. To be on the safe side, consider speaking to a financial adviser before getting started with ETF’s.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nThere are numerous banking services available to the average individual looking to make sound financial decisions. That being said, not all banks are good for everyone. This is because we all have different financial goals and wants. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the factors you should consider when looking for a bank that’s right for you.\r\n\r\n## What are Your Financial Goals?\r\n\r\nAt any point in time, our financial goals are changing and different. For example, a college student might look for a bank that has multiple ATM’s in and outside of campus for easy access to his or her cash, and international businessmen may prefer a bank that makes it easy for them to carry out transactions from different countries as well as trade on an international level. Be sure to ask the bank if they offer the services that you’re most interested in, and opt for a bigger bank if you’re looking for convenience as well as innovative products such as online banking, paying bills using your phone and more.\r\n\r\n## Take a Closer Look at the Fees\r\n\r\nA lot of people get attracted to banking packages because of clever and slick advertising. Doing so only sets you up for failure since you are not likely to do adequate research before signing on the dotted line. Make sure to ask exhaustive questions regarding fees such as\r\n\r\n- ATM Fees\r\n- Over the counter withdrawal fees\r\n- Deposit fees\r\n- Overdraft fees\r\n\r\nAll these should weigh heavily in your decision since these fees do add up and may eat into your finances over a long period of time.\r\n\r\n## Do Your Research and Ask Around\r\n\r\nIn order to find an ideal bank, you should have [a selection of financial institutions that you can pit against each other](https://banks.credio.com/). This usually means looking into what benefits one bank has over another, as well as each bank’s unique premise. Ask friends about what banks they would recommend, and look into online forums to get different views of what banks are ideal. If you do decide to go by word of mouth, just remember that unhappy customers complain the most, and that this may not be an accurate picture of a bank, especially on online forums as well as social media. Once you’ve done your research, consider approaching each bank with your data and ask if they can match the other bank’s offer. The idea here is to get the best deal by pitting one financial institution against the other.\r\n\r\n## FDIC insured Banks Should Be Your Priority\r\n\r\n[FDIC insurance](https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/banking/facts/) basically applies to savings accounts and protects your finances should your bank find itself in financial trouble, forcing it to shut down. That being said, FDIC insurance also applies to the following types of bank accounts:\r\n\r\n- Checking accounts\r\n- Money market accounts\r\n- CD’s\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nIn case you’re looking for a bank that earns you the highest interest rate for your cash, consider a reward checking account or internet bank account. At the end of the day, what you settle on should be in line with your goals and needs. Make sure to ask lots of questions and read the fine print before signing off at the dotted line.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nThe word retirement send shivers up the spines of most people because of the amount of time and effort it will take most, if not all of us to get there. This traditional-based kind of thinking shouldn’t be something that limits you. Retiring early, even in your thirties is possible, as long as you make some smart decisions earlier on in life. In this post, we’ll take a look at some vital tips to help you retire in your thirties.\r\n\r\n## Start Saving Early\r\n\r\nWe realize that this is a given for most people. That being said, a lot of us think that saving usually entails working up towards a goal. Here are some of the things you need to do in order to boost your savings from a young age:\r\n\r\n- Invest in [high-yield investments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencelight/2013/01/07/how-to-find-low-risk-high-return-investments/) that have a 10 to 15 year cash out in your late teens\r\n- Create a budget and stick to it. This will leave you with cash you can save every month\r\n- Put money into a low fee, high interest savings account\r\n- Pay off debt early so you have extra cash to save.\r\n- Take on a second job in an area you’re passionate about. Shunt away money from this job into a savings account.\r\n- Make sure to save at least 30 percent of your salary.\r\n\r\n## Downsize Your Life\r\n\r\nRetiring in your thirties can only be possible if you make some drastic financial decisions. In fact, you may need to adopt a near-frugal lifestyle in order to make this dream happen. Start by minimizing your costs and spending money on absolute necessities. Here are other tips on how you can adopt a financially minimalist lifestyle:\r\n\r\n- Unsubscribe to cable and consider Netflix and going out to watch movies instead\r\n- Use only a few necessary credit cards. Resist the temptation to take out new ones\r\n- Turn down your thermostat. People can hardly tell the difference if it’s a few degrees lower\r\n- Opt for cheaper wine instead of buying the expensive stuff\r\n- Look into buying pre-owned furniture. Look at sites such as Craigslist for this.\r\n- Don’t buy a new car. Go for something classic since these tend to last longer and cost much less maintenance-wise.\r\n- Live closer to your place of work to save on fuel or commuting costs.\r\n\r\n## Follow Your Passion, However Risky.\r\n\r\nA lot of us would rather work in a dead-end job than pursue their passions because they think that it might not work out due to the inherent risks in doing so. The truth is, most people who have been able to retire early followed their passion and made boatloads of money doing so. [By doing what you’re most passionate about](https://zenhabits.net/live-passion/), you’ll be able to provide value as long as you’ve perfected your craft. Most time, people will pay top dollar for your skill, helping you bring in more money than you would have garnered in an average office job.\r\n\r\nOther important indices to pay attention to if you’d like to retire early include taking stock of your quarterly net worth, annual investing portfolio return and monthly expenses. These should be revised as needed every couple of months to ensure you’re on target towards reaching your early retirement goal.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\nCredit card usage is at an all-time high. Due to the imperfect nature of the financial systems we have come to rely on, errors may appear when making transactions, resulting in issues such as double billing, being charged for a different product or service or not getting a discount on a discounted product. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the ways in which you can dispute a credit card charge without having to resort to extraordinary measures.\r\n\r\n## Document Everything\r\n\r\nBefore contacting the credit card issuer or merchant, it’s very important to get your story right before making any claims. Not only will this help you get audience with the right people much faster, it will also help you deal with any issues that may arise in the future such as tax issues. Take photos of everything, and then draft a letter which highlights the steps you took before the error was made. In addition, you may want to send the letter to both your merchant and credit card issuer to make sure both parties are kept in the loop.\r\n\r\n## Act Fast and Immediately\r\n\r\nRules passed by the Federal Trade Commission give victims of such errors some leeway with regard to refunds. However, it’s important to report the issue as soon as possible since delaying may absolve the merchant and card issuer of any liability. Ideally, you should report the error on the same day.\r\n\r\n**According to** **the Fair Credit Billing Act passed in 1975\\*\\***, billing errors include:\\*\\*\r\n\r\n- Unauthorized of fraudulent use of your card\r\n- [Charges listing the wrong amount or date](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0219-disputing-credit-card-charges)\r\n- Math errors, example a double charge for the same transaction\r\n- Being charged for services or goods that you did not receive according to your agreement with the merchant or those that you didn’t accept\r\n- Failure to post things like returns or payments\r\n\r\n## Reach out to the Supervisor or Manager\r\n\r\nNormally, a credit card dispute will be resolved by a supervisor if you just pick up the phone and call. However, some of these supervisors are under instructions not to authorize refunds, so it might be necessary to ask to speak to the manager. According to the law, you can dispute an error 60 days from when you discover it, so you may need to remind the merchant of this if you feel like you aren’t going anywhere with the negotiations.\r\n\r\n## Final Words\r\n\r\nIt’s important to keep paying what’s owed by you even when you’re waiting to have your error reversed. This is because if you don’t, you may have a drop in your credit score since regardless. It’s important to stay calm and organized as you dispute these charges since being emotional may hurt your credibility as well as sour the relationship you have with the merchant as well as card issuer. At the end of the day, you as a card holder are protected by various laws that you can find [here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/resolving-consumer-problems). Lastly, be persistent and consistent since an initial ‘no’ may change to a ‘yes’ after some time.\r\n"

Quality, it seems, is directly proportional to price even when the evidence doesn’t point to this. We have been primed to believe that we’ll get a better quality item if we pony up. A lot of us do so, albeit grudgingly. If you’re living on a tight budget, you may find it hard or close to impossible to pay more for quality. In this post, we’ll give you tips on how to get quality items or services without having to shell out mountains of money.\r\n\r\n## Patience Should Be Your Best Friend\r\n\r\nPatience, especially when it comes to purchasing a coveted item can go a long way in ensuring that you stay true to your financial goals and budget. Most items are usually priced much higher the moment they hit the market. This is because manufacturers and marketers know that there is a huge demand for these products and that people are willing to pony up whatever price to have their hands on that particular item. Wait a few months to a year, and the price will plummet just enough for you to afford it.\r\n\r\n## Research and Compare\r\n\r\nDue to the massive competition between stores and brands these days, there are always offers flying around to entice buyers to buy a certain brand’s item. [This competition is good for the consumer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/competition-good-for-consumers-less-for-capitalists-letters-to-the-editor-1411158314) since you get to compare prices and choose one that fits your budget. Sign up for reminders on comparison websites, and install browser add-ons that track offers for you so you can get the best deal in the long run.\r\n\r\n## Set Up a Specific Savings Fund\r\n\r\nPaying a large amount of money for an item can seem soul-draining and painful. If you’re really set on making a certain purchase, set up a savings fund where you’ll get to deposit a certain amount of money in it until you reach your goal. This way, you’re able to break down the item price, making it seem not as expensive.\r\n\r\n## Consider Getting the Same Item but From another Brand\r\n\r\nBranding is big business. At the same time, a certain branded item doesn’t necessary trump others with regard to quality. Unless you’re crazy about labels, you should consider shopping around and considering other brands that have the same, if not better quality of item you’d like to purchase.\r\n\r\n## Exceptions to the Rule\r\n\r\nSometimes, [it’s a good idea to pay the price if you’re looking to purchase quality](https://moneybulldog.co.uk/the-things-that-are-worth-paying-a-bit-extra-for/). This is especially true of items that you use on a daily basis such as electronics and clothing. These items, if bought for cheap can fall apart in months or less than a year, sending you back to the store to buy more which in the end may ruin your budget.\r\n\r\nBy shopping smart, doing your research and refusing to be drawn into the Joneses’ world, you may be able to get all the quality items you need, all the while keeping your budget intact for a long time to come.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n[![auction](/auction-1024x681.jpg)](/auction.jpg)\r\n\r\nAuctions are great places to pick up items that are as good as those you might find at your local Wal-Mart brand new. In addition, the excitement and different types of people will lead you to other interesting finds and deals in other locations if you’re willing to make friends and network. That being said, auctions such as those held at flea markets or a designated auction building can be fraught with many financial and [psychological traps](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/place_your_bids/). In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the things you should do if you’d like to beat the competition as well as get a fair price on the things that you’re looking to bid on.\r\n\r\n## Dress Conservatively and Appropriately\r\n\r\nAuction events attract different types of people. However, it’s not uncommon for the head auctioneer to start high or suddenly increase the price if he sees someone he perceives to be well-off bidding on an item. You want to dress in a simple manner to throw people off so they don’t see you as a threat.\r\n\r\n## Do Your Research Beforehand\r\n\r\nIf you have a list of the items that are going to be bid on, your first port of call should be the internet. If, for example, there’s going to be a ’75 Chevy up for sale at the auction, you should check out various valuation and [price comparison websites](https://www.edmunds.com/) so you can get a good average price. Get to know the features that come with the item so you can negotiate and bid from a place of strength.\r\n\r\n## Do Not Show Excitement or Desire\r\n\r\nA lot of auctions usually go by the mood in the air at the time of the auctioning. Auctioneers who have been doing this kind of work for years know how to read this mood and then determine their starting bid by this mood. You should try as much as possible to remain unemotional if you would like to throw off anyone’s scent, including fellow bidders.\r\n\r\n## Willpower is Key\r\n\r\nIt’s so easy to lose yourself to the excitement of bidding and go over what you had intended on spending for that particular day. This can only create a vicious cycle as well as an addiction to all things auctions. Know and write down the amount you are looking to spend that day and stick to it. If you think that you’re going to break and overdo it, bring along a friend who can help keep you in check.\r\n\r\n## Competition Doesn’t Help\r\n\r\nNo matter how much you want what’s up for bidding, don’t be tempted to compete with the other bidders. This will start a bidding war which will eventually involve your ego and that of others, creating a situation where all self-control goes out the window just so you can outdo everyone else. Pace yourself, and choose the best time to hone in on you kill with regard to your maximum price.\r\n\r\nAuctions usually prefer instant payment as well as collection of goods, so be prepared to take your items to your waiting car as soon as possible in order to avoid any extra charges such as storage fees. Happy bidding!\r\n"

This kind of thinking led to the 2008 recession as well as a lot of pain and stress for millions of Americans all over the country. Being in debt has a way of affecting your mental state, especially if it’s your first time to rack in a huge amount owed by you to different sources such as the bank, credit card companies and loan providers. Debt can do some serious damage to your mind, body and psyche if left unchecked. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the [emotional and psychological effects of debt](https://smartasset.com/personal-finance/does-debt-affect-mental-health) and what you can do about them.\r\n\r\n## Being in Debt and Fear\r\n\r\nFear is an instinctual and powerful emotion that may have served its purpose during the early evolutionary period of man. It was useful in our survival as a species in the face of dangerous animals, helping us flee from the offending animal as fast as our legs can carry out. The problem with reacting in a fearful manner when it comes to the debt you’ve accrued over the months or years is that it can make you run away from your problems as well as stop you from seeing that what you’re mentally running away and hiding from isn’t as scary as it seems.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to get your fear in check, you may want to start by making small steps towards tackling your debt. One way you can do this is by automating debt payment so that you’re not hit with a wave of apprehension every time your monthly bills come in.\r\n\r\n## Being in Debt and Low Self-Esteem\r\n\r\nWe all have dreams of a better life. Progress is the only way to live life, and almost everyone would like to have their finances under control. Debt, on the other hand, has a way of sneaking up on us, causing untold misery. A lot of people identify with their debt and come to the erroneous conclusion that they are not good people on account of their spending habits. If you find yourself being hard on yourself, it’s important to stop and think and take stock of your life. We all make mistakes and learn from them. Beating yourself up will only lower your self-esteem. This will, in turn, make it hard for you to make sound decisions going forward when it comes to deciding how to tackle your debt.\r\n\r\nA great way of not getting yourself stuck in a vicious cycle of self-berating, self-pity and the resultant low self-esteem would be to [forgive and give yourself some leeway](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-11454/10-ways-to-forgive-yourself-let-go-of-the-past.html) every time you catch yourself doing this. Remind yourself of the many times you paid your bills on time and make sound financial decisions. Come up with a list of 10 things that you have achieved personally and financially and look at them every time you feel yourself going down the pity path.\r\n\r\n## Debt, Stress and Depression\r\n\r\nThe thought of tackling your debt can paralyze you with fear, making it hard for you to make the first step. This compounds your life’s stresses, which in turn shuts your mind down, leading to negative thoughts and feelings, and eventually depression. While this is a serious condition, it’s possible to get out of it with a bit of work. See a doctor if your depression is causing you not to function on a daily basis. Doing something such as exercising or seeing a debt counselor can help a great deal when it comes to beating the stress and depression related to stress.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, debt shouldn’t be in control of your life and emotional health if you follow the recommendations we’ve outlined in this article. The most important things are carrying out self-evaluation, being honest and taking action; these three can go a long way in helping you finally tackle your credit woes once and for all.\r\n"

      "content": "\r\n[![donate](/donate.jpg)](/donate.jpg)\r\n\r\n[The 2008 financial crisis hit many Americans hard](https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/debt/financialcrisis.html), making life hard for millions of individuals across the country. On top of that, there are many organizations that are struggling to raise enough cash to help feed the homeless or simply come up with enough research money to go into discovering a cure for a disease. If you’re on a budget, there are ways you can help out without breaking the bank.\r\n\r\n## In-Store Donation Options\r\n\r\nLots of stores usually have a jar situated at the checkout counter where you can drop some spare change into to help different causes. In other stores, the cashier would ask you if you’d like to donate a dollar to a special cause. Alternatively, consider purchasing canned food and leaving it by the collection point outside the store. These are usually picked up by various organizations who are interested in feeding a particular group of people such as the homeless and at-risk teens.\r\n\r\n## Donate Your Expertise\r\n\r\nA great way of spending zero dollars but still getting in on the help train is to donate your expertise to organizations that need it. Struggling groups who may need accounting help for example could really use someone with this kind of expertise who is ready to work for free. The upshot to volunteering is that you’ll get to meet and network with individuals who will benefit your professional life, opening you up to lucrative opportunities in the future should you need them.\r\n\r\n## Donate Your Time\r\n\r\nOrganizations in need usually don’t have the funds to hire someone to carry out different tasks such as cleaning up after the people they take care of or cooking on a regular basis. By donating your time, you get to garner priceless life experience that can help you through life with regard to things like flexibility, compassion and empathy.\r\n\r\n## Pack Up and Donate Stuff\r\n\r\nIf you look around your home, you’re bound to identify stuff that’s probably just cluttering up your home. These items may be in need in places such as orphanages and homeless shelters. Pay attention to necessities such as blankets, plates, cups, children’s toys and books since these are what’s needed the most. If you want to be more effective, call ahead and ask them what they have a shortage of and base your list off theirs.\r\n\r\n## Medical Donations\r\n\r\nOrganizations such as [the Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/en) are always looking for medical donations, specifically blood. If you’re healthy, consider making multiple donations every month. If you’d like something that pays you back, consider making plasma donations. Please be aware that the former takes a bit more time, so be prepared to spend quite a bit of your time at hospital to get this done.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, donating doesn’t really have to be about money. There are other intangible and abstract ways you can do so, all the while making sure that you’re well on your way to maintaining your financial goals regardless of whichever way you choose to offer help to those that need it.\r\n"
