# Milton Bolonha

</div>

Hi, I'm Milton Bolonha and I've been developing websites since 1998.

As a specialist, I curate and implement sustainable code. I have unique knowledge of the technology market. I work as a technology manager with proficiency in document management and optimizing advertising reach. I direct investments and make strategic decisions in marketing, advertising, and branding.

I have extensive experience in the Brazilian and global technology market. I am an Artificial Intelligence engineer, an open-source project manager, and I teach programming.

## Professional Summary

This book is an initiative of mine, technology mentor Milton Bolonha.

I have been a programmer and designer since 1998, a philanthropist since 2007, an Amazon best-selling author since 2018, and a "Top Rated" software engineer on UpWork since 2018.

I started learning to program at the age of 11 in the late '90s. I have always been self-taught and had to develop my own methods for understanding web programming.

Since then, I have developed literally thousands of websites, applications, and systems. My boldest career move was trying life in the capital city of São Paulo for the first time, leaving a town with a population of 20,000. And it worked!

From São Paulo to many other places. I also went through global financial crises, constant and devastating political crises in this field, and a pandemic.

I am a volunteer teacher in philanthropic services and have always loved making a difference in the lives of the people around me.

Over these years, with an extensive career in web development, I had opportunities both in Brazil and abroad, being nationally recognized as a programmer in the United States, Italy, and France.

Based in San Francisco, CA, USA, I am part of the GitHub Developer Program, which means I will provide you with all the GitHub support you need.

Through the 100 Open Startup program, I was hired by the healthcare giant HapVida for online technology consulting.

My startup Edu4Dev was evaluated by ACBOOST 22 of the São Paulo Commercial Association. Edu4Dev stood out with above-average product and governance in the program.

I worked for over 2 years at the American web agency Green Hat Web Solution. Green Hat is an agency specializing in WordPress.

Descola is an innovative startup in the field of courses, and its main partner is Cubo Itaú. They use technology created by me on their blog, with the same standards used in this book.

I have a long career in volunteer services, starting this passion in Paraíba between 2007 and 2009 with philanthropic (non-paid) work in various cities in the state.

# Static Export

</div>

## What is `output: 'export'`?

The `output: 'export'` configuration in Next.js allows for the generation of a static version of your application. Instead of dynamically rendering pages on the server during runtime, all pages are pre-rendered into static HTML files during the build process. These static files can be served by any web server that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an efficient way to host your site.

## How Does It Work?

When you enable `output: 'export'` in the `next.config.js` file and run the `next build` command, Next.js generates an `out` folder containing all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JS files for each route in your application. These pages are generated statically, meaning the content remains fixed until a new build is executed.

## Key Benefits

- **Optimized Performance**: With all pages pre-rendered, initial load times are drastically reduced, providing a faster user experience.

- **Enhanced SEO**: Static HTML pages are easier for search engines to index, improving your site's SEO.

- **Simplified Hosting**: The site can be hosted on any service that supports static files, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, without the need for a Node.js backend.

- **Cost Reduction**: By eliminating the need for a dynamic server, hosting costs can be significantly reduced.

- **Simplified Maintenance**: The simplicity of a static site reduces complexity in server maintenance and monitoring.

- **Ideal for Static Content**: Perfect for sites like blogs, landing pages, documentation, and portfolios where content doesn’t need frequent dynamic updates.

Static export is ideal for projects that don't require real-time dynamic rendering. It's especially useful for pages that remain unchanged until the next build, ensuring superior performance and a consistent user experience.

### Server Rendering Benefits

1. **Data Fetching**: Server-side components allow data fetching to occur closer to the data source, improving performance by reducing fetch times and the number of client requests.

2. **Security**: Keeping sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, reduces the risk of exposing them to the client.

3. **Caching**: Server-side rendering allows results to be cached and reused across requests and users, enhancing performance and reducing costs.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Server components can reduce the amount of client-side JavaScript needed, benefiting users with slower internet or less powerful devices.

5. **Initial Page Load and First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Server-side HTML generation allows users to see the page immediately without waiting for JavaScript to download and execute.

6. **SEO and Social Network Shareability**: Rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots for indexing and social networks for generating previews.

7. **Streaming**: Server components allow rendering work to be split into chunks and streamed to the client as they become ready, allowing users to see parts of the page earlier.

8. **Static Export for IoT**: In IoT environments, where devices often have limited processing power and connectivity, serving static content can optimize performance and reduce system complexity.

1. Pre-Build Sync Pipeline
   1. Create JSON from markdown files
1. Build Pipeline
   1. Generate sitemaps
   1. Generate ads.txt
   1. Generate SCSS files
   1. Sync public files
   1. Clean old GitHub Action files
   1. Schedule posts
1. Post Build GitHub Actions
   1. Schedule posts
   1. Content update

The pipeline structure adopted in this project represents the culmination of two decades of web development experience and five years of intensive research and study in technologies like React, serverless, and static websites. This meticulously designed architecture not only optimizes efficiency but also ensures quality and consistency in site development and maintenance.

## Pre-Build Sync Pipeline

The first stage, the Pre-Build Sync Pipeline, involves creating JSON files from markdown files. This conversion is essential to ensure that all content is properly structured and ready for use, preserving the integrity and consistency of the data.

### Step 1: Create JSON from Markdown Files

This step involves converting all markdown (.md) files into JSON format. The JSON files are essential for the build process as they provide structured data that can be easily consumed by the application. This process ensures that all content is properly formatted and ready for the subsequent build steps.

## Build Pipeline

The second stage, the Build Pipeline, encompasses several critical operations:

### Step 1: Generate Sitemaps

Sitemaps are crucial for SEO and ensuring search engines can efficiently index the site's content. This step generates XML sitemaps for both posts and pages, providing a comprehensive map of all the site's content.

### Step 2: Generate ads.txt

The ads.txt file is used to declare authorized digital sellers for the site’s ad inventory. This step ensures that the ads.txt file is generated and up-to-date, protecting the site from unauthorized ad sales.

### Step 3: Generate SCSS Files

This step compiles SCSS (Sass) files into CSS, ensuring the styles for the site are up-to-date and consistent. This is important for maintaining the look and feel of the site across different pages and posts.

### Step 4: Sync Public Files

During this step, all necessary files are synchronized to the Next.js public folder. This includes images, scripts, and other static assets that need to be available publicly. Syncing these files ensures that the latest versions are available to users.

### Step 5: Clean Old GitHub Action Files

Old GitHub Action files, particularly those related to scheduled posts, are cleaned up in this step. This helps in maintaining a clean and efficient workflow, preventing any unnecessary or outdated actions from being triggered.

### Step 6: Schedule Posts

This step involves creating workflows for scheduled posts using GitHub Actions. It ensures that posts are published at the right times according to the defined schedule, leveraging Netlify build hooks for automated deployments.

## Post Build GitHub Actions

After building, GitHub Actions play a vital role:

### Step 1: Schedule Posts

This GitHub Action is responsible for triggering Netlify builds based on a defined schedule. It ensures that the site is rebuilt and updated regularly, according to the specified cron job. This helps in maintaining fresh and up-to-date content on the site.

### Step 2: Content Update

This action is triggered by updates to the content, specifically changes in the content/posts and content/pages directories. It synchronizes the project, creates necessary JSON and XML files, and commits the changes back to the repository. This ensures that any content updates are promptly reflected in the site's build, maintaining consistency and accuracy.
