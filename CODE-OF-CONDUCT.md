# Code of Conduct for Contributors

## Our Promise

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community,
we, as contributors and administrators of this project, pledge
to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of personal appearance, disability,
ethnicity, gender, age, gender identity or expression, sexual identity
or orientation, national origin, experience level, physical build,
race, or religion.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism with grace
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy for other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Using sexual language or imagery and unwanted sexual attention or advances
- Insulting and/or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks (_Trolling_)
- Public or private harassment
- Posting personal information about others without explicit permission, such as an email or home address
- Any other form of conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional environment

## Our Responsibilities

Project administrators are responsible for clarifying the standards of behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
to any instance of unacceptable behavior.

Project administrators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, bugs, or other forms of contributions that do not comply with this Code of Conduct, as well as to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for any other behavior that is deemed inappropriate, dangerous, offensive, or problematic.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces or any public space where someone represents the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by the project administrators.

## Enforcement

Abusive, harassing, or other behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at general@stardose.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is necessary and appropriate to the situation. The team is required to maintain confidentiality regarding the individual who reported the incident. Further details of enforcement policies may be posted separately. Project administrators who fail to follow or uphold the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project leadership.
